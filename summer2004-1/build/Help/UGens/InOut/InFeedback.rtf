\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 *ar(bus, numChannels)\
	\
		bus 
\f2\b0 - the index of the bus to read in from.\
		
\f0\b numChannels 
\f2\b0 - the number of channels (i.e. adjacent buses) to read in. The default is 1.\
\
When the various output ugens (
\f0\b Out
\f2\b0 , 
\f0\b OffsetOut
\f2\b0 , 
\f0\b XOut
\f2\b0 ) write data to a bus, they 
\f3\i mix
\f2\i0  it with any data from the current cycle, but 
\f3\i overwrite
\f2\i0  any data from the previous cycle. (
\f0\b ReplaceOut
\f2\b0  overwrites all data regardless.) Thus depending on node order and what synths are writing to the bus, the data on a given bus may be from the current cycle or be one cycle old at the time of reading. 
\f0\b In.ar
\f2\b0  checks the timestamp of any data it reads in and zeros any data from the previous cycle (for use within that node; the data remains on the bus). This is fine for audio data, as it avoids feedback, but for control data it is useful to be able to read data from any place in the node order. For this reason 
\f0\b In.kr
\f2\b0  also reads data that is older than the current cycle.\
\
In some cases we might also want to read audio from a node later in the current node order. This is the purpose of InFeedback. The delay introduced by this is at maximum one block size, which equals about 0.0014 sec at the default block size and sample rate.\
\
The variably mixing and overwriting behaviour of the output ugens can make order of execution crucial. (No pun intended.) For example with a node order like the following the InFeedback ugen in Synth 2 will only receive data from Synth 1 (-> = write out; <- = read in):\
\
Synth 1 -> busA					this synth overwrites the output of Synth3 before it reaches Synth 2\
Synth 2 (with InFeedback) <- busA \
Synth 3 -> busA\
\
If Synth 1 were moved after Synth 2 then Synth 2's InFeedback would receive a mix of the output from Synth 1 and Synth 3. This would also be true if Synth 2 came after Synth1 and Synth 3. In both cases data from Synth 1 and Synth 3 would have the same time stamp (either current or from the previous cycle), so nothing would be overwritten.\
\
Because of this it is often useful to allocate a separate bus for feedback. With the following arrangement Synth 2 will receive data from Synth3 regardless of Synth 1's position in the node order.

\f2\fs24 \cf0 Synth 1 -> busA\
Synth 2 (with InFeedback) <- busB \
Synth 3 -> busB + busA \
\
The second example below demonstrates this issue.
