# SuperCollider on WebAssembly

This file documents the current status on getting the project to build for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (wasm).

## Introduction

WebAssembly is a near-native format for running code on the client-side of the browser. That is, similar to JavaScript for
which a runtime environment is provided virtually by every mainstream browser, this relatively new standard competes in a
similar space, allowing for more performance oriented code to be executed and targetting lower-level languages such as
C or C++.

Compiling SuperCollider to wasm means that a real-time generative sound piece can run in a user's browser without
the need to install any software or to set up a streaming server. Other computer music systems like PD and CSound have also
explored this possibility. Essentially, one takes an existing code base and adapts it to use the
[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) where
normally a driver such as Port Audio or Jack would sit. Any interactive "control" of the application then goes through
JavaScript which can bridge to the wasm application.

As a side note, wasm can also run stand-alone in a native container outside of a browser, which may or may not be,
depending on the application, an interesting format to compile to, as it allows to deliver a binary in a cross-platform manner.
Since SuperCollider depends on maximising performance, this avenue is currently not explored, but it may be interesting
for processor architectures which are otherwise not supported by the native machine code builds.

## Overview

Current, the SuperCollider __server__ (scsynth) can be embedded using the WebAssembly architecture. In the future, this
may extend to __sclang__ as well (see 'clients' section).

The build process is similar to the regular CMake build, but using the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org) instead.
Emscripten allows to build C and C++ applications through a customised LLVM compiler (Clang), emitting wasm binaries.

The following limitations are currently in place:

- _libsndfile_ is disabled, thus accessing sound files and using UGens such as `DiskIn` does not work. This can be 
  solved in the future.
- the X11-based UGens, `MouseX`, `MouseY`, etc., are not available.
- the deprecated [ScriptProcessorNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScriptProcessorNode) Web Audio API
  is used, which means that the DSP loop runs in the main JavaScript thread, being prone to drop outs as the browser's
  user interface is used. In the future, one might look into using
  [AudioWorkletProcessor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletProcessor) -- but this complicates
  the build process, as need to generate a dedicated wasm binary per thread, which then need to communicate with each
  other. Emscripten already uses different workers for the
  phtreads, and it is unclear how pthreads and audio worklets would coexist.
- enabling _pthreads_ (the standard UNIX threads used by regular scsynth) means that a so-called `SharedArrayBuffer` 
  is used for the static heap memory of the application. This feature is enabled on Chrome/Chromium, but in Firefox it
  is disabled for security reasons _unless_ your site sets [COOP and COEP](https://web.dev/coop-coep/) for strong isolation.
  That means making the wasm application run in [different browsers](https://caniuse.com/sharedarraybuffer) may pose
  additional efforts in terms of configuring the web server.
- the web [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) only does processing when there 
  has been _user interaction_, in order to avoid that malicious websites bombard the user with sound without prior
  permission. This is solved by requiring the user to press a 'boot' button first, for example.

## TODO

- [ ] OSC return/reply messages are not yet implemented. The main question is how to allocate the memory,
      as probably an asynchronous invocation `MAIN_THREAD_ASYNC_EM_ASM` should be used.
- [ ] I/O is currently hard-coded for 0 input channels and 2 output channels. This is easy to fix.

## Building

One needs to install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org), see
[download instructions](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
The installation described there should work:

    $ ./emsdk install latest
    $ ./emsdk activate latest
    $ source ./emsdk_env.sh

Then you prefix `cmake` by `emcmake`, e.g.:

    $ emcmake cmake -DSC_EL=no -DSUPERNOVA=no ... -s USE_PTHREADS=1 -s WASM=1 --target scsynth ..

The full set of flags and settings for emcmake can be seen in the provided build scripts:

- `./wasm/configure.sh` runs emcmake with reasonable parameters
- `./wasm/make.sh` runs the 'make' task for target 'scsynth'.

Both scripts are called subsequently when running `build.sh`. For example:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../wasm/build.sh

Technically, what is built is `server/scsynth/scsynth.*` with a runtime library `*.js`, the actual binary `*.wasm`
and a wrapping HTML `*.html`. The standard plugins (UGens) are statically linked and thus available.

When successful, the `make.sh` script also takes care of copying the .js and .wasm files emitted by the process
from `server/scsynth/` to `../wasm/`. In other words, the `wasm` directory contains everything necessary to
execute scsynth in the browser (see section 'Running').

_Note:_ Sometimes, when running `make.sh` for a while, there appears an error:

> System LLVM compiler cannot be used to build with Emscripten! Check

The reason for this is unclear at the moment -- removing and recreating the `build` directory and running the full
build again "solves" this.

## Running

The file `wasm/index.html` takes care of loading scsynth. It can be used as a template for more customised running.
To use this index, start a local webserver inside the `wasm` directory, for example:

    $ cd ../wasm/
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open the server's address, e.g. `0.0.0.0:8000`. in the browser.

Emscripten uses a JavaScript object named `Module` to contain all information on the wasm binary. For example,
`Module.arguments` can be used to specify the command line arguments for scsynth. By default, we set
`-u 57110 -D 0 -i 0 -o 2`; scsynth.wasm uses the UDP switch to open an OSC communication for the client. This is not
a regular UDP connection, but a more simple mechanism (see 'Clients' section). The `-D 0` switch prevents scsynth
from trying to initially "load" synthdefs from a file system which does not exist in this way in the browser.
If you want to access the microphone input, you would set for example `-i 2`.

The `index.html` includes a [JavaScript OSC library](https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js) and defines a few utility functions:

    sendOSC(name, args...)

    sendOSC_t(name, typeTags, args...)

They can be used to talk to the server after it has been booted. For example, you can print the node tree:

    sendOSC("/g_dumpTree", 0, 1)

or

    sendOSC_t("/g_dumpTree", "ii", 0, 1)

Some of the SuperCollider OSC API works with either float `"f"` or int `"i"` arguments, and the `sendOSC` treats all numbers
as floats. However, some commands do not work properly without int arguments, therefore it is preferred to use the
`sendOSC_t` function and explicitly specifiy the type tags.

    d_bubbles()

Sends a `/d_recv` command with the well-known `"AnalogBubbles"` example by James McCartney. You can then start a synth using:

    s_bubbles()

which is equivalent to:

    sendOSC_t("/s_new", "siii", "AnalogBubbles", 1000, 1, 0)

If you want to use other synthdefs, you have to compile them to their binary blobs (as `Uint8rray`) and send them like this:

    sendOSC_t("/d_recv", "b", blob)

The blob can be obtained for example from sclang:

    SynthDef("gcd", {
	    var mx = LFNoise1.kr(0.1).range(-20, 20);
        var my = LFNoise1.kr(0.1).range(-20, 20);
        var sn = SinOsc.ar(SinOsc.kr(0.1) * 20 lcm: [mx, my] * 30 + 500) * 0.1;
	    Out.ar(0, sn);
    }).asBytes.printOn(Post); nil

Copying the result from the post window and replacing `Int8Array[ ... ]` by `Uint8Array.from([ ... ])`.

To enable OSC dump:

    dumpOSC(1)

To set controls on a synth:

    sendOSC_t("/n_set", "isf", 1000, "freq2", 444.1)

To free the synth:

    sendOSC_t("/n_free", "i", 1000)

See the 'Server Command Reference' help file for an overview of OSC commands.

## Clients

A [client](https://supercollider.github.io/community/systems-interfacing-with-sc) currently has to communicate to scsynth via 
the `Module` JavaScript object, and while in the future an `sclang.wasm` is possible, clients for now are to be running in 
JavaScript (or be written in a language that can compile to JavaScript). While one can write directly JS code that uses the
OSC interface, more viable candidates may be:

- [ScalaCollider](https://www.sciss.de/scalaCollider/) -- while it cross-compiles to JavaScript, the OSC interface will have be 
  to adapted
- [supercollider.js](https://crucialfelix.github.io/supercolliderjs/) -- this was designed to run in Node.js and communicate with 
  a regular scsynth process, but probably it will be simple to adapt it for usage with scsynth.wasm.
- probably clients written in Python, like [supriya](https://github.com/josiah-wolf-oberholtzer/supriya), and in
  [other languages](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS) could potentially
  run in the browser as well
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) may also be an interesting option to communicate with scsynth.wasm.

scsynth.wasm is started with a port number (defaults to 57110) for OSC communication.
The interface is available through `Module.oscDriver`:

    var od = Module.oscDriver;
    od.send(client, server, data);

Where `client` and `server` are virtual port numbers, for example `57120` and `57110` respectively. The client or source port number
allows to receive OSC replies from the server. To do so, an OSC end-point function must be registered:

    od[57120] = function(server, data) { console.log("Received data from " + server) };

The OSC data is always a plain `Uint8Array` which must be properly encoded and decoded, for example in JavaScript using the
[osc.js](https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/) library mentioned above (`osc.writePacket()`, `osc.readPacket()`). You can
look at the definition of `sendOSC_t` in `index.html` to see how package encoding works.

__Note:__ Reply messages are currently unimplemented (TODO)!

## Source Code

The main additions to the SuperCollider C++ source code are the classes `SC_WebAudioDriver` (file `server/scsynth/SC_WebAudio.cpp`)
and `SC_WebInPort` (in file `server/scsynth/SC_ComPort.cpp`), implementing the Web Audio API driver bridge and the OSC replacement
respectively. Throughout, conditional compilation is done by preprocessor `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` statements using the symbol
`__EMSCRIPTEN__`. In the file `server/scsynth/CMakeList.txt`, the symbol to look out for is `EMSCRIPTEN`.

### Modifications to Libraries

__nova-tt__: There are `ifdef`s in nova-tt `thread_priority_mach.hpp` and `thread_priority_pthread.hpp` to bypass unsupported API.
For this reason, a fork of nova-tt is used in git-modules. It may be that these changes are no longer necessary (TODO: check).

__boost__: An assertion error was found in boost:

```
scsynth.html:1246 Assertion failed: priv_end_block() == end_block, at: /home/hhrutz/Documents/devel/supercollider/external_libraries/boost/boost/interprocess/mem_algo/rbtree_best_fit.hpp,410,priv_add_segment
printErr	@	scsynth.html:1246
abort	@	scsynth.js:1475
___assert_fail	@	scsynth.js:2082
boost::interprocess::rbtree_best_fit<boost::interprocess::mutex_family, boost::interprocess::offset_ptr<void, long, unsigned long, 0ul>, 0ul>::priv_add_segment(void*, unsigned long)	@	scsynth.wasm:1
...
```

Without further investigation, the assertion is now disabled in `rbtree_best_fit.hpp`, line 410.

## Performance Considerations

The current build is not optimised for speed or code size. This is a task for the future.

`-s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0` -- this allegedly causes performance issues, so should eventually be removed again.

Disabling the catching means we can have meaningful exception message ('what') print-outs in the browser console. This is
usually needed when trying to understand why something crashed.
