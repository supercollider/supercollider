Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Mac OS X version of James McCartney's SuperCollider
synthesis engine (scsynth) and programming language (sclang).
Supercollider's main homepage is at:

   http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

To get further information on SuperCollider usage or development, you
should subscribe to the mailing lists:

   http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/880

Do not use non-ASCII characters (above code point 127) in your SuperCollider program path. Doing so will break options to open class or method files automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mac OS X 10.4.9 or greater
Xcode Tools 2.4.1 or greater

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easy way:
	./clean-compile.sh
	./package.sh

Your build will be placed in a directory named "SuperCollider".

If you run into problems building the most likely cause is that you are
not running the correct version of the Xcode tools. You must be running
2.4.1 or above!

Building within Xcode:
	There are three projects that should be BUILT IN THIS ORDER:

	Synth
	 - the synthesis server application

	Plugins
	 - the UGens and plugins

	Language
	 - the OS X application with text editor, language interpreter,
	   event scheduling etc.

The package.sh script does several maintenance tasks (fixing creator
codes, exporting from svn, etc) and creates a ready-to-distribute zip of
SuperCollider.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cmake
------------------------------------------------------------------------

to build supercollider with cmake, it is suggested to do out-of-tree
builds in a specific build directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

to run the build process run:
make

the build process can be configured using the cmake program, cmake
frontends like ccmake or cmake-gui, or by simply editing the
build/CMakeCache.txt file.

for example to enable a release build run the following in your build
directory:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

for a 32bit build on a 64bit machine (i.e. recent Mac systems), you need to configure cmake like this:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 ..

for the BIG universal binary (on 10.6), use:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='ppc;i386;x86_64' ..

to install the whole program, run:
make install

On Mac, this will create a SuperCollider directory in the build directory (rather then installing the program to the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local)

to uninstall:
make uninstall

------------------------------------------------------------------------
On libsndfile
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling a universal binary of libsndfile requires access to both a
i386 and PPC Mac. The reasons for this are described here:

http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/FAQ.html#Q018

Because of this, libsndfile is included with the source as a precompiled
universal binary. This UB contains ppc, i386 and x86_64 archs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building - 10.6 and 64-bit scsynth and plugins
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to do the following to build a 64-bit scsynth and plugins.
Open the XCode projects for Synth and Plugins
Double-click each target, and change the
	Architectures setting to 'Standard (32-bit/64-bit Universal)
	Base-SDK to 10.5
	(optional and recommended): Compiler to GCC 4.2 (if available)

This definitely works in Mac OS 10.6, probably 10.5, and these builds will NOT support 10.4

XCode in 10.6 uses the GCC 4.2 compiler by default, and this compiler will NOT work with the 10.4 SDK (the default SDK). You will need to either set your build SDK to 10.5 or 10.6 inside each XCode project, or inspect (double-click) each target and set GCC 4.0 as your compiler.

UPDATE - There is now a Deployment32-64 build style that should build SuperCollider from source out of the box on 10.6. You can also use the compile.sh script and pass in ARCHS=32_64 as a flag:
    ./compile.sh ARCHS=32_64
This should build a 32/64 bit version of scsynth and the plugins and a 32-bit SuperCollider.app. This build style should use the 10.5 SDK by default.

The 10.6 SDK still has some problems. If you are on 10.6, please make sure you have installed the 10.5 SDK installed with the developer tools.

Thanks to James McCartney, for making this great piece of audio
software publicly and freely available.
