Changes for the 1.1.0 release (vs 1.0.2) are listed below. Unless
otherwise indicated these changes have been made since 
January 2013. The focus has been on general clean-up, fixing bugs,
compiler errors and warnings, and fixing issues on 64 bit platforms. 
A few improvements such as support for OSC arrays, functions
for setting broadcast and reuse socket options have been added.
This update merges changes from the openFrameworks version 
of oscpack.

    - Added support for arrays in messages (see OscUnitTests.cpp 
    for example usage). (patch thanks to Tim Blechmann)
    
    - Fixed bugs relating to 64 bit usage (e.g. crashes in 64 bit 
    builds on OS X).
   	
    - Some member functions that previously used the "int" or
    "unsigned long" type for parameters or return values now use 
    std::size_t (platform-defined) or 
    osc_bundle_element_size_t (a.k.a. int32).   
    This change  was made to better support 64 bit platforms.
    See SVN revision 70 for details.
    
    - The previous point introduces a breaking change on Linux/x86_64
    for callers of AsBlob() and AsBlobUnchecked():
    The type of the second argument (the "size" argument) to
    ReceivedMessageArgument::AsBlob() and 
    ReceivedMessageArgument::AsBlobUnchecked() has changed
    from unsigned long & to osc_bundle_element_size_t (an int32). 
    You should declare your size argument variables as 
    osc_bundle_element_size_t to avoid incompatibilities between 
    32 and 64 bit builds.

    - Note that oscpack does not support packets larger than
    0x7FFFFFFC (see comments in class ReceivedPacket for
    details).
    
    - Oscpack defines an osc::Nil value used for sending the nil 
    message argument value. This conflicts with Objective-C. 
    Therefore osc::Nil is no longer defined in  Obj-C++ code. 
    There is now an osc::OscNil value, which should be preferred. 
    osc::Nil is still available when writing C++.
    (fix thanks to openFrameworks)
    
    - Added UdpSocket::SetEnableBroadcast(). This needs to 
    be called to enable sending to the broadcast address on some
    platforms (e.g. Mac OS X). (thanks to openFrameworks)
    
    - Added UdpSocket::SetAllowReuse(). This is useful for 
    sharing sockets on some platforms (Mac?), and not so useful 
    on other platforms. (thanks to openFrameworks)
    
    - Added IpEndpointName::IsMulticastAddress() (2010)
    
    - Cleaned up C++ header usage and std:: namespace usage
    to be more standards compliant (fixes issues on recent compilers
    such as clang and gcc4.6).
   	
    - Improved host endianness detection. Should auto-detect
    endianness on most platforms now.
    (thanks to Tim Blechmann for help with this)
    
    - Fixed two memory leaks: (1) in OscPrintReceivedElements.cpp
    when printing time tag message arguments (thanks to Gwydion ap Dafydd). 
    (2) in the posix SocketReceiveMultiplexer::Run() method if an exception 
    was thrown while listening.
    
    - Fixed bug in posix SocketReceiveMultiplexer::Run() that would cause 
    packets to stop being received if select() returned EINTR. 
    (thanks to Björn Wöldecke)
    
    - Updated and improved Makefile to avoid redundant re-linking
    (thanks to Douglas Mandell)
   
    - Added CMakeLists.txt CMake build file (2010, thanks to David Doria)
     
    - Switched license to plain MIT license with non binding request
    for contribution of improvements (same as current PortAudio 
    boilerplate). See LICENSE file.

Thanks to Tim Blechmann, Rob Canning, Gwydion ap Dafydd, David Doria, 
Christopher Delaney, Jon McCormack, Douglas Mandell, Björn Wöldecke,
all the guys at openFrameworks, and everyone who reported bugs, 
submitted patches and helped out with testing this release.

Thanks to Syneme at the University of Calgary for providing financial 
support for the 1.1.0 update.

------------------

Compared to the previous official snapshot (November 2004) the 
current version of oscpack includes a re-written set of network 
classes and some changes to the syntax of the networking code. It no 
longer uses threads, which means that you don't need to use sleep() 
if you are writing a simple single-threaded server, or you need to 
spawn your own threads in a more complex application.

The list below summarises the changes if you are porting code from 
the previous release.

    - There are no longer any threads in oscpack. if you need to 
    set up an asynchronous listener you can create your own thread 
    and call Run on an instance of SocketReceiveMultiplexer or 
    UdpListeningReceiveSocket (see ip/UdpSocket.h) yourself.
    
    - Host byte order is now used for network (IP) addresses
        
    - Functions which used to take two parameters <address, port> 
    now take an instance of IpEndpointName (see 
    ip/IpEndpointName.h) this class has a number of convenient 
    constructors for converting numbers and strings to internet 
    addresses. For example there is one which takes a string and 
    another that take the dotted address components as separate 
    parameters.
    
    - The UdpTransmitPort class, formerly in UdpTransmitPort.h, is 
    now called UdpTransmitSocket, which is simply a convenience 
    class derived from UdpSocket (see ip/UdpSocket.h). Where you 
    used to use the constructor UdpTransmitPort( address, port) now 
    you can use UdpTransmitSocket( IpEndpointName( address, port ) 
    ) or you can any of the other possible ctors to IpEndpointName
    () (see above). The Send() method is unchanged.
    
    - The packet listener base class is now located in 
    ip/PacketListener.h instead of PacketListenerPort.h. The 
    ProcessPacket method now has an additional parameter indicating 
    the remote endpoint
    
    - The preferred way to set up listeners is with 
    SocketReceiveMultiplexer (in ip/UdpSocket.h), this also allows 
    attaching periodic timers. For simple applications which only 
    listen to a single socket with no timers you can use 
    UdpListeningReceiveSocket (also in UdpSocket.h) See 
    osc/OscReceiveTest.cpp or osc/OscDump.cpp for examples of this. 
    This is more or less equivalent to the UdpPacketListenerPort 
    object in the old oscpack versions except that you need to 
    explicitly call Run() before it will start receiving packets 
    and it runs in the same thread, not a separate thread so Run() 
    won't usually return.
    
    - Explicit calls to InitializeNetworking() and 
    TerminateNetworking() are no longer required for simple 
    applications (more complex windows applications should 
    instantiate NetworkInitializer in main() or WinMain (see 
    ip/NetworkingUtils.h/.cpp)
    
    - The OscPacketListener base class (OscPacketListener.h) was 
    added to make traversing OSC packets easier, it handles bundle 
    traversal automatically so you only need to process messages in 
    your derived classes.
    
    - On Windows be sure to link with ws2_32.lib or you will see
    a linker error about WSAEventSelect not being found. Also you 
    will need to link with winmm.lib for timeGetTime()
