These objects hold information about a Player's inputs and outputs.  They are used to make connections to other Players, and to manage that connection and all subsequent repatching or disconnections. \
\
PatchIn objects hold NodeControl objects that enable communication to one input of a Node (Synths and Groups), either for setting the value or mapping the input to read from a Bus.\
\
PatchOut objects hold either Bus objects (for audio and control) or sources (for control and scalar).  Bus objects hold the information about the Bus that the Player is playing onto.  sources are client side objects that produce float values to send to the inputs of Nodes.   Possible sources are gui objects like sliders or Patterns and other automatons.  Anything that can respond to .value with a Float can be a source for a ScalarPatchOut.\

Both PatchIn and PatchOut remember who they are connectedTo.  PatchOuts may be connected to multiple PatchIns.\

	group\
		plays at group of head\
	integer\
		default server, audio output number\

they should be even gui-able, a drag drop\
\
maybe even a player makes ins and outs when created\
\
prepare(group)\
	sets the patchOut group, where it will be created\
	\
patchIn\
	also hold source ?, search for synth\

			sets nodeControl if playing,\
			else when it plays it will get the value\
\
		if player is not playing anywhere else\
			if input is reading from something else\
				insert mixer\
\
\
	drag filter to player\
\
		if player is not playing anywhere else\
			node after\
			same buss for out\
			filter reads from that buss\
\
			this is a kind of player			\

		if player is playing to another filter\
			remove other\
			node after\
