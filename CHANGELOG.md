Fixed a number of rendering warnings from SCDoc ([#4265](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4265))

3.10.4 (2020-01-16)
===================

Xcode 11 is now supported ([#4611](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4611)).

Minimum supported Boost version is now 1.66.0 ([#4611](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4611)). Boost 1.71 is also now supported ([#4612](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4612)).

supernova would sometimes return malformed `/done` OSC messages over TCP due to a concurrency issue. This has been fixed ([#4435](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4435)).

On macOS, Cmd+Q causes a segmentation fault in sclang. This is a regression from old behavior, where Cmd+Q is simply ignored. This has been fixed ([#4533](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4533)).

Fixed a mistake where `Recorder` would get its default file extension from `server.recHeaderFormat` rather than its own `recHeaderFormat` ([#4550](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4550)).

The `NodeProxy` `filter` role now respects `fadeTime` ([#4278](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4278)).

Some sequences of IDE actions involving editor splits (such as removing a split and then recompiling the class library) can lead to an eventual IDE crash. These have been fixed ([#4645](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4645)).

On macOS, Cmd+Q used to quit both the IDE and interpreter, but it regressed and only the interpreter would quit. This has been fixed ([#4300](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4300)).

3.10.3 (2019-08-30)
===================

General: Fixed
-----

For people compiling with musl libc, some build errors have been fixed ([#4535](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4535)).

scsynth and supernova: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** scsynth had a security issue where it listens to 0.0.0.0 by default. For most users, this is undesirable behavior since it allows anyone on your local network to send messages to scsynth! This default has been changed to 127.0.0.1 ([#4516](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4516)). To change it back (e.g. for networked server/client setups), use `-B 0.0.0.0` at the command line or `server.options.bindAddress = "0.0.0.0"`.

scsynth and supernova: Fixed
-----

On Windows, scsynth was not able to select separate input and output devices. Since many audio drivers present inputs and outputs as separate devices, this caused major blocking issues for anyone using Windows with an external sound card. This has been fixed ([#4475](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4475)).

Fixed a supernova compilation issue on Boost 1.67 ([#4447](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4447)).

Fixed server hangs happening in plugins employing SequencedCmd ([#4456](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4456)).

UGens: Fixed
-----

Fixed an initialization issue for the `trig` input to `Convolution2` ([#4341](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4341)).

sclang: Added
-----

sclang and the IDE can now be compiled without QtWebEngine -- just set `SC_USE_QTWEBENGINE=OFF` at the `cmake` stage ([#4328](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4328)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

The `mouseWheelAction` of `View` erroneously reported `xDelta` and `yDelta` to be 0 in some cases. This is fixed ([#4423](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4423)).

Fixed incorrect mathematics in `SimpleNumber:series` ([#4454](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4454)).

Fixed a harmless but annoying warning in when running `HelpBrowser.instance` in sclang without the IDE ([#4488](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4488)).

Class library: Added
-----

The `-B` command-line flag to scsynth was missing a frontend in `ServerOptions`. This has been fixed by introducing `ServerOptions:bindAddress` ([#4516](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4516)).

Add `Platform.hasQtWebEngine` to query whether sclang was compiled with QtWebEngine support ([#4523](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4523)).

Class library: Fixed
-----

Fix issues when using a regular `Buffer` (that is, not a `LocalBuf`) for FFT ([#4050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4050)).

Lots of small issues in `Plotter` were fixed, especially related to the `domain` and `domainSpec` arguments ([4082](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4082)).

When changing the source of an input to a `NodeProxy`, discontinuities can happen even when smooth crossfading is requested. This has been fixed ([#4296](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4296)).

`ProxyMixer` no longer assumes the `ProxySpace` it is using to be the current environment ([#4339](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4339)).

The default recordings directory on Windows was the somewhat redundant `My Documents\SuperCollider\SuperCollider\Recordings`. The additional `SuperCollider` subdirectory has been removed ([#4420](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4420)).

In Events where `strum` is set, the releases of notes was erroneously done in reverse order. This is fixed ([#4406](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4406)).

Fix `EnvirGui` always creating a `SkipJack` due to incorrect logic concerning the `makeSkip` flag ([#4376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4376)).

`SkipJack` would not remove itself properly when stopped by its stopTest. This is fixed ([#4376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4376)).

Fixed class library compilation issues on Qt-less sclang installations ([#4219](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4219)).

IDE & SCDoc: Fixed
-----

Fixed crashes trying to run multiple IDEs at once, and a related error when attempting to run `HelpBrowser:instance` in sclang while an IDE help browser is open ([#4267](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4267)).

On macOS, Cmd+Q in the IDE would quit the interpeter but not the IDE. This is a regression from old behavior where the IDE was quit entirely. This has been fixed ([#4300](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4300)).

Since 3.10, the help browser would execute code twice when selected. This has been fixed ([#4390](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4390)).

Fix footnotes adding unwanted line breaks in SCDoc ([#4365](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4365)).


3.10.2 (2019-02-08)
===================

Due to immature development status and lack of cross-platform compatibility, **MainMenu is no longer created by default** ([#4285](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4285)). It can be re-enabled by running `MainMenu.initBuiltInMenus` (add this to your startup file to permanently re-enable). The API for MainMenu is subject to change in the future.

MainMenu consumes less resources and no longer causes a gradual memory leak ([#3870](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3870)).

Fix SCIDE missing an icon on some Linux desktop environments ([#4269](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4269)).

Fixed incorrect parsing of strings containing `\"` and single-quote symbols containing `\'` in class library files ([#4255](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4255)).

Fixed language-side issues when using FFT UGens on a regular Buffer rather than a LocalBuf ([#4050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4050)).

Added `TempoClock:isRunning` method ([#4254](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4254)).

Fixed some compiler warnings ([#4275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4275), [#4274](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4274)).

3.10.1 (2019-01-17)
===================

Fixed an infinite hang in `SerialPort.devices` affecting macOS ([#4180](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4180)).

Fixed `ServerOptions` producing eight channels instead of two channels when explicitly setting `numOutputBusChannels` or `numInputBusChannels` ([#4251](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4251)).

Fixed a build issue on OpenBSD ([#4203](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4203)).

Fixed `/b_fill`, which was broken in supernova ([#4188](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4188)).

Fixed incorrect latency compensation in PortAudio driver ([#4210](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4210)).

The `CheckBadValues` UGen incorrectly recognized zero as a bad value on Windows. This has been fixed ([#4240](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4240)).

Fixed `crtscts` flag in `SerialPort.new`, which broke in 3.10 ([#4191](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4191)).

Fixed lack of `backgroundImage` support for `Slider2D` ([#3952](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3952)).

Fixed incorrect behavior of `String:asSecs` ([#3819](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3819)).

`0X0` is an illegal hexadecimal literal in sclang, but SCIDE and SCDoc highlighted such strings as if they were correct. They have been updated ([#4170](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4170)).

Fixed weird colors in SCIDE when changing from other themes to the "classic" theme ([#4161](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4161)).

Known issues
------------

- FileDialog can hang — currently we are only able to reproduce on KDE, but other OS's could be affected ([#3807](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3807)).
- On Windows and Linux, running code with Ctrl+Enter in the help browser (not the editor) only evaluates the current line ([#3989](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3989)).
- QtWebEngine, a hard dependency of SCLang and SCIDE, is difficult or impossible to install in some environments ([#4010](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4010)). Work is underway to make it an optional component, but this will not happen in time for 3.10.

General: Added
-----

A `NO_X11` option has been added to the build system so that server plugins requiring an X server such as MouseX can be omitted ([#3738](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3738)).

General: Changed
-------

sclang and scide have long been stuck with Qt 5.5 due to Qt dropping QtWebKit for QtWebEngine. They have been upgraded for compatibility with Qt 5.7+. We recommend using the most recent version of Qt. The impacts of this change include:

- sclang and scide now build on Visual Studio 2015 and later. (Previously, Windows users had to obtain the now-ancient Visual Studio 2013.)
- UserView now supports Retina/HiDPI display.
- A somewhat different build process on Linux. See the README.

The minimum required version is now CMake 3.5 instead of CMake 2.8 ([#3656](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3656)).

scel (the emacs package) is now a submodule ([#3519](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3519)).

General: Fixed
-----

Many issues with Unicode paths on Windows were fixed in 3.9. A few remaining cases involving sound files remained, and are now fixed ([#3720](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3720)):

- supernova's sound file backend, buffer manager, and plugin loading
- NRT mode in scsynth
- `/b_read` family of commands in scsynth
- `SoundFileView` in the sclang GUI

Fixed a build failure with the CMake option `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP=on` ([#3558](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3558)).

Fixed a misleading deprecation warning when `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set to the home directory in Linux ([#3613](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3613)).

Fixed `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` incorrectly defaulting to `/usr/local/` on macOS under some conditions ([#4043](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4043)).

scsynth and supernova: Added
-----

supernova now has latency compensation ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).

scsynth and supernova: Fixed
-----

scsynth's latency compensation had a math error that ended up doubling the latency. It is fixed now ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).

For consistency with scsynth, supernova no longer requires the final argument to `/b_allocReadChannel` ([#3826](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3826)).

Fixed a missing newline in some of supernova's error messages ([#3897](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3897)).

Fixed errors in supernova's `/s_getn` ([#3893](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3893)).

Fix supernova's response to `/g_queryTree` so it matches scsynth ([#3221](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3221)).

UGens: Fixed
-----

Fixed clicks in Convolution2L ([#3687](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3687)).

sclang: Added
-----

Menus are now supported in the Qt GUI. See help files for `Menu`, `MenuAction`, `ToolBar`, and `MainMenu` ([#2504](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2504)).

Added wrappers for over 100 special mathematical functions (gamma function, Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, etc.) from the Boost library ([#3672](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3672)).

SerialPort now works on Windows ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).

`FileDialog` and `Dialog` now support a "path" argument that specifies a default directory when the dialog appears ([#3508](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3508)).

`QTreeView` has a new method: `setColumnWidth` ([#3560](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3560)).

sclang: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** `Float:asString` now always produces a decimal point, so `3.0.asString` is now `"3.0"` instead of `"3"` ([#3585](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3585)).

**Breaking change:** The `server` argument has changed to `target` in `Function:asBuffer`, `Function:loadToFloatArray`, and `Function:plot`, and now allows spawning the plotting synth relative to a group or node rather than just a server ([#3088](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3088)).

**Breaking change:** `File:mkdir` now returns a Boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. Previously, it returned the File object ([#3635](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3635)).

Scrollbars now always appear for ScrollView on Linux an Windows, as a temporary workaround for a very odd dependency on the use of the scroll wheel ([#3686](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3686)).

sclang: Removed
-------

Removed some unused Qt dependencies from the build system ([#3472](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3472)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

**Breaking change:** Fixed a long-standing math error in `SimpleNumber:expexp` ([#3786](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3786)).

Fixed extreme CPU usage of sclang when built without Qt ([#3772](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3772)).

On Windows, the directory where extensions were installed was accidentally changed in 3.9. It has been reverted ([#3751](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3751)).

Fixed a crash when calling `File.copy` when the destination exists ([#3633](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3633)).

Fixed two `Array:lace` issues: a crash when any element is an empty array, and an error when no length argument is provided and any element is not an array ([#3716](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3716)).

Fixed conditions where `Integer:forBy` can cause sclang to freeze when the step size is 0 or a floating point value with an absolute value less than 1 ([#3804](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3804)).

Fixed some incorrect output in `FunctionDef:dumpByteCodes` ([#3803](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3803)).

Fixed `Node:release` getting stuck on negative release times, which are now equivalent to 0 ([#3741](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3741)).

Fixed `==` on `Signal` objects randomly returning the wrong result ([#3970](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3970)).

Class library: Added
-----

`UnitTest.passVerbosity` allows changing the verbosity of test failure reports. See the `UnitTest` help file for more information ([#3615](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3615)).

Added new UGen methods `.snap` and `.softRound` ([#3429](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3429/files)).

`Node:query` has a new `action` argument, allowing specification of a callback function ([#3701](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3701)).

`.degrad` and `.raddeg` are now implemented for UGens ([#3821](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3821)).

Class library: Changed
-------

The default behavior of `SerialPort.devices` pattern matching has been improved to match a wider variety of devices on macOS and Linux ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).

Internal calls to `.interpret` have been removed from `Color.fromHexString` and `History.unformatTime`, improving both performance and security ([#3527](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3527)).

Class library: Deprecated
----------

`SerialPort.cleanupAll` is deprecated ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).

Providing an integer index for `SerialPort.new` is deprecated ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).

Class library: Fixed
-----

`BufWr.ar` no longer allows its input signals to be control rate, which caused the server to read from garbage memory ([#3749](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3749)).

`Buffer:query` returned incorrect results if multiple query messages are sent at once. This has been fixed ([#3645](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3645)).

Fixed fragilities in path joining methods such as `+/+`, `withTrailingSlash`, and `withoutTrailingSlash` ([#3634](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3634)).

Fixed bugs when certain pattern classes are passed in 0 as the number of repeats ([#3603](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3603)).

Fixed `Event.addEventType` ignoring the `parentEvent` argument ([#3736](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3736)).

Fixed `Pkey` being skipped because the default number of repeats is `nil` instead of `inf` ([#3724](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3724)).

Fixed some harmless but annoying errors about extensions of nonexistent classes when sclang is built without Qt ([#3770](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3770)).

`ProxySpace:linkDoc` was broken — switching documents did not actually change ProxySpaces. This is fixed now ([#3764](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3764)).

`Recorder:prepareForRecord` produced an error if the recordings path does not exist. It now makes the directory if it doesn't exist ([#3788](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3788)).

Fixed bugs when providing multiple paths in `ServerOptions:ugensPluginPath` ([#3754](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3754)).

Fixed `HelpBrowser` (the class, not the IDE help browser) being unusable since it didn't trigger rendering of help files when links are clicked ([#3832](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3832)).

Fixed some bugs in `EnvGate`: throwing an error when `fadeTime` is a constant rather than a UGen input, and `i_level` not behaving as documented ([#3797](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3797)).

Fixed occasional hangs when rebooting supernova ([#3848](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3848)).

Fixed confusing user feedback with the "Check for updates" button in the quarks GUI ([#3986](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3986)).

`Buffer` methods ensure that the buffer number in outbound OSC messages is an integer ([#3907](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3907)). This fixes errors in supernova, which is stricter than scsynth about the buffer number type.

Fixed confusing user feedback with the "Check for updates" button in the quarks GUI ([#3986](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3986)).

Fixed missing default arguments in `fold2`, `wrap2`, and `excess` methods of `Collection` for consistency with `SimpleNumber` ([#4037](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4037)).

Fixed incorrect template matching behavior in `OSCFunc` and related functionality ([#4027](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4027)).

Fixed "Message 'extension' not understood" preventing `Image` from working ([#3728](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3949)).

IDE & SCDoc: Added
-----

The IDE has a prettier default theme ([#4025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4025)). The old theme still exists as "classic."

The IDE now properly highlights scale degree literals like `4s` ([#4032](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4032)).

IDE & SCDoc: Changed
-------

The IDE has a prettier default theme ([#4025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4025)). The old theme still exists as "classic."

The IDE now has a unified look across all platforms, and its color scheme adapts to match the editor theme ([#3950](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3950)).

The SCDoc TOC and menubar have been redesigned again ([#3831](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3831)).

Various tweaks to the appearance of the IDE: nicer tabs ([#3992](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3992)), better border colors ([#4022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4022)).

IDE & SCDoc: Fixed
-----

When starting the IDE, detached docklet sometimes spawn as unresponsive. This has been fixed ([#3660](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3660)).

Syntax colors in the help browser now match the IDE ([#3883](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3883)).

Only one preference window can be open at a time now ([#3988](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3988)).

Fixed tabs reversing in order when restoring a session ([#3942](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3942)).

==================

Contributors to this release: brianlheim, mneilsen, patrickdupuis, telephon

General: Fixed
-----

It is now possible to build the project using a system install of yaml-cpp. Previously the `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP` CMake option was broken ([#3557](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3557)).

Improvements to documentation on writing and designing classes ([#3605](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3605)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

Fixed a regression from 3.8 to 3.9 that prevented the tilde character from being expanded to the user's home directory during class library compilation ([#3646](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3646)).

Class library: Fixed
-----

Fixed an issue with handling of ranges in `RangeSlider:setSpan` and `:setDeviation` ([#3620](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3620)).

Fixed a regression in `Score`'s multichannel expansion from 3.9.1 to 3.9.2 ([#3608](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3608)).

3.9.2 (2018-03-23)
==================

Contributors to this release: adcxyz, brianlheim, davidgranstrom, jamshark70, patrickdupuis, snappizz, telephon, vivid-synth

General: Fixed
-----

Improvements to various documentation pages ([#3587](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3587), [#3526](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3526))

Fixed CMake configuration errors that prevented successfully building on Windows when the project path contains spaces ([#3525](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3525)).

UGens: Fixed
-----

Fixed PSinGrain growing in amplitude after it was supposed to finish ([#3494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3494)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

sclang now creates a configuration directory on startup, rather than waiting for it to be created by another action. This step is skipped if sclang is run as a standalone (-a) or if a language config file is specified with the -l option ([#3577](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3577)).

`SequenceableCollection:unixCmd` now allows respects `PATH` instead of strictly requiring the executable path ([#3501](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3501)).

Class library: Added
-----

A new method, `Platform:killProcessByID`, was added ([#3499](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3499)).

Class library: Changed
-------

`LanguageConfig:store` throws an error if it fails to write ([#3577](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3577)).

Class library: Fixed
-----

Fixed an off-by-one error in a warning message for `Server:clientID_` ([#3487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3487)).

`Event:isRest` now returns true if the event's `\isRest` entry is `true`. This usage was backported from 3.8 and is deprecated ([#3521](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3521)).

`Server` now tries to recover in the case of a lost connection between client and server ([#3486](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3486)).

Fixed an error when producing a `Score` containing an `Event` with a multichannel `timingOffset` ([#3544](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3544)).

IDE & SCDoc: Fixed
-----

The help browser table of contents popout no longer has redundant "table of contents" text ([#3576](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3576)).

3.9.1 (2018-02-05)
==================

Contributors to this release: antonhornquist, aspiers, brianlheim, cappelnord, florian-grond, gusano, jamshark70, patrickdupuis, redFrik, shimpe, telephon

General: Added
--------------

Introduced Guard integration that allows sclang UnitTests to be automatically rerun whenever a file changes ([#3369](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3369)).

Bleeding-edge builds are now uploaded for Windows. See the Windows README for details ([#3441](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3441)).

General: Fixed
--------------

Debugging information is improved when building a Windows installer package ([#3464](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3464)).

scsynth and supernova: Fixed
----------------------------

supernova only looked for plugins in a `plugins/` subfolder of the provided extensions directory. This has been fixed to be consistent with scsynth ([#3433](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3433)).

UGens: Fixed
------------

Fixed `Index`, `IndexL`, `FoldIndex`, `WrapIndex`, `IndexInBetween`, and `DetectIndex` incorrectly downsampling audio-rate index arguments ([#3436](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3436)).

sclang: Fixed
-------------

The GUI class library folders were installed even when building sclang without Qt, resulting in unbound primitives. This has been fixed ([#3456](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3456)).

Some default class library directories had to be manually created. sclang will now create them for you if they don't exist ([#3469](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3469)).

Class library: Fixed
--------------------

Fixed a Routine not being properly terminated when running `CmdPeriod.run` (or hitting an equivalent shortcut) when a `Server:plotTree` window is open ([#3423](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3423)).

Fixed `LevelIndicator:style_` doing nothing and printing the warning `Qt: WARNING: Do not know how to use an instance of class 'Meta_QLevelIndicatorStyle'` ([#3398](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3398)).

Fixed `Git.checkForGit` returning `nil` ([#3445](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3445)).

The SynthDef compiler optimizes `a + b.neg` to `a - b`, but other UGens that depend on `b.neg` would also be incorrectly removed in some cases. This has been fixed ([#3437](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3437)).

In 3.9.0, the `group` key broke in the "grain" event type. This has been fixed ([#3483](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3483)).

IDE & SCDoc: Added
------------------

New IDE themes have been introduced for the editor and post window: Solarized, Solarized Dark, and Dracula ([#3412](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3412), [#3410](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3410)).

IDE & SCDoc: Changed
--------------------

Set the default font in the IDE for macOS to Monaco, instead of the rather silly non-monospace font that has been the SC default for over a decade ([#3404](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3404)).

IDE & SCDoc: Fixed
------------------

Fixed duplicate SCIDE icons in GNOME, and fixed the SCIDE icon looking wrong ([#3380](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3380)).

Fixed SCDoc breaking with page titles containing a single quote character ([#3301](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3301)).

Fixed an error due to lack of input sanitization when trying to open help (Cmd+D/Ctrl+D) or references (Cmd+U/Ctrl+U) on text containing a double quote character ([#3277](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3277)).

3.9.0 (2018-01-13)
======================

We are proud to announce the arrival of SuperCollider 3.9.0! Apologies
for being so far behind schedule; we hope the improvements you'll find here
will more than make up for it. In 3.9.0, determined contributors have fixed
some of SuperCollider's major cross-platform compatibility demons, addressed
longstanding issues in the IDE and language, and added new features and bugfixes
across the board.

Known Issues
------------

The IDE server status display turns yellow after a few seconds when opening `s.makeGui`.  This does not cause any usability issues ([#3310](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3310)).

Only the first pages of the HTML files produced by SCDoc are printed in web browsers ([#3395](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3395)).

The help browser does not remember the last position open in a document when navigating through history, and just jumps to the top of the file ([#3396](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3396)).

Supernova loads plugins from "Extensions/plugins" rather than "Extensions" ([#3391](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3391)).

`LevelIndicator.style()` is broken, which leads to confusing warning messages ([#3398](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3398)).

`File.copy` crashes the interpreter if the destination file exists ([#3401](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3401)).

On Windows, SerialPort is not available ([#1008](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/1008)).

On Windows, Supernova is not available.

On Windows, the command-line sclang interpreter is not available.

General: Added
-----

scvim has seen numerous enhancements now that an actively maintained fork has been merged in ([scvim #11](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim/pull/11)).

SuperCollider can now be built on Windows using the MSYS2 toolchain, thanks in particular to @awson and @bagong. ([PortAudio #1](https://github.com/supercollider/portaudio/pull/1), [HIDAPI #5](https://github.com/supercollider/hidapi/pull/5), [#2473](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2473), [#2704](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2704))

SuperCollider can now be built on FreeBSD, thanks to @shamazmazum and @yurivict ([#2834](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2834), [#2704](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2704), [HIDAPI #8](https://github.com/supercollider/hidapi/pull/8), [#3131](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3131)).

Detailed documentation on creating macOS standalone applications with SuperCollider has been added, thanks to @adcxyz ([#2881](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2881)).

Support for multiple sclang clients connecting to the same server is greatly improved, thanks to @adcxyz.

A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md have been added to the repository ([#3001](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3001)).

Higher-resolution raster versions of the SC cube logo have been added to the top-level `icons/` directory ([#3023](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3023)), and a retina-friendly `.icns` file ([#3060](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3060)).

General: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** `sc_gcd` in the plugin interface now conforms to `gcd(n, 0) == n` instead of `gcd(n, 0) == abs(n)` ([#2980](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2980)). This also affects the method `SimpleNumber:gcd`.

The macOS plist file now shows the full version number for both the Version String and Shortened Version String ([#2487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2487)).

General: Fixed
-----

A typo in the build system prevented the `-msse` compiler flag from being properly set for gcc and clang ([#2623](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2623)). This *may* fix subnormal number issues in scsynth that some users have been experiencing.

Fixed a fontification break in scel when too many classes are defined ([#2508](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2508)).

Fixed build failures on FreeBSD ([#3126](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3126)), GCC 7 ([#3226](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3226)), and newer versions of Boost ([#3227](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3227)).


scsynth and supernova: Added
-----

scsynth and supernova now support a `/version` command, which responds with a message of the form `/version.reply program major minor patch branch commit` ([#2546](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2546), [#2598](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2598)). See the Server Command Reference for full details.

scsynth and supernova: Changed
-------

On macOS, if scsynth's input and output devices have mismatched sample rates, an error is thrown and the server does not boot. Setting the number of input channels to 0 (`-i 0` on the command line and `s.options.numInputBusChannels = 0` in sclang) now bypasses this error ([#2610](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2610)).

Disabled Nagle's algorithm for TCP communication in scsynth ([#2613](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2613)). Nagle's algorithm increases bandwidth at the cost of delay, which is undesirable in the context of SuperCollider. Both supernova and sclang have it turned off.

scsynth and supernova: Fixed
-----

The `/b_read` and `/b_readChannel` messages experienced intermittent failures to read sound files, most notably affecting `Buffer.cueSoundFile`. This has been fixed ([#2793](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2793)).


UGens: Added
-----

A new UGen, `Sanitize`, replaces infinities, NaNs, and subnormals with another signal, zero by default ([#2561](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2561)).

The `doneAction` argument to DetectSilence can now be modulated ([#2379](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2379)).

UnaryOpUGen now supports the bitwise not operator `bitNot` ([#2381](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2381)). It used to simply fail silently.

UGens: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** The application binary interface (ABI) for server plugins has changed ([#3129](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3129)). This has an important impact: **plugin binaries compiled for SuperCollider 3.8 will not work with SuperCollider 3.9** and vice versa. Please recompile your plugins.

**Breaking change:** `FOS.ar` with control-rate coefficient inputs incorrectly initialized its coefficients at 0 and ramped to the correct values over the first control period. This has been fixed ([#2658](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2658)). To restore old behavior, multiply each coefficient by `Line.ar(0, 1, ControlDur.ir)`.

UGens: Deprecated
----------

`Donce`, a demand-rate UGen with no identifiable purpose, is deprecated ([#2564](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2562)). It was most likely used in the production of electronic donce music.

UGens: Fixed
-----

A number of UGens were discovered to have serious initialization bugs ([#2333](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2333)) where the UGen would output an initial sample of garbage memory. This can create audio explosions if the buggy UGen's output is fed into certain filter UGens like LPF or Delay1. These bugs have been fixed, affecting:

- BeatTrack
- BeatTrack2
- CoinGate
- Convolution
- Convolution2
- Convolution2L
- Convolution3
- DetectSilence
- DiskIn
- DiskOut
- IFFT
- KeyTrack
- LFGauss
- PartConv
- PV_JensenAndersen
- PV_HainsworthFoote
- RunningSum
- StereoConvolution2L
- Unpack1FFT

Fixed a bug with `TGrains` ignoring the `amp` parameter ([#2809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2809)).

`Dibrown` no longer ignores the `length` argument ([#2654](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2654)).

`Pitch` no longer ignores the `median` argument ([#2953](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2953)).

Fixed a build error in DiskIOUGens on Windows ([#3015](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3015)).

Fixed `AudioControl` outputting garbage data if a bus is mapped to it but nothing is playing to the bus ([#3063](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3063)).

Fixed incorrect math in `PanAz.ar` with audio-rate input signal and position ([3139](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3139)).


sclang: Added
-----

Regression tests for the sclang lexer, parser, and compiler have been added ([#2751](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2751)). This will make it easier to make fixes to these components in the future.

sclang: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** sclang's nestable multiline comments had some mistakes. In particular, sometimes sclang's lexer would incorrectly process overlapping combinations of `/*` and `*/`, so e.g. `*/*/` would be interpreted like `*/ /* */`. This has been fixed ([#2625](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2625)).

The maximum number of MIDI ports has been increased from 16 to 128 ([#2494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2494)).

The startup post "NumPrimitives = #" is reworded to "Found # primitives" ([#3139](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3139)).

sclang: Removed
-------

Removed some unhelpful memory addresses from call stack output in error printing ([#2951](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2951)).

Removed some accidentally retained debug posts when the language starts up ([#3135](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3135)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

Fixed help files failing to open on Windows if the user's name contains a non-ASCII character ([#2861](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2861)).

Fixed non-ASCII characters breaking the Visual Studio debugger ([#2861](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2861)).

Fixed a crash in `Object:perform` when the selector is an Array whose first element is not a Symbol, e.g. `0.perform([0])` ([#2617](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2617)).

`thisProcess.nowExecutingPath` is no longer corrupted by `Routine:stop` ([#2620](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2620)).

`TextView:selectedString_` now works when the selection size is zero ([#2648](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2648)).

Fixed a crash when a method or class/instance variable is named "`none`" ([#2638](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2638)).

Exceptions occurring in primitives no longer print unavoidable error messages even when wrapped in try-catch ([#2876](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2876)).

Fixed a crash when `Dictionary:keysValuesArrayDo` is called with `nil` as an argument ([#2799](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2799)).

Fixed `WebView:onLinkActivated` handler failing to fire ([#3003](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3003)).

Fixed GUI objects failing to display when launched from the `action` of `unixCmd` ([#3009](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3009)). You will still need `{ }.defer`, however.

Fixed `QImage:getColor` always returning zero for the green channel ([#3190](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3190)).


Class library: Added
-----

The UnitTest quark has been incorporated into the main repository ([#3168](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3168)).

Added a `rewind` method to `CollStream` ([#2400](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2400)).

Added four new class methods to `File` for convenience: `readAllString`, `readAllSignal`, `readAllStringHTML`, `readAllStringRTF` ([#2410](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2410)).

`Pstep` accepts an array as a duration argument ([#2511](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2511)).

Help files originating from extensions now display a plaque for visibility ([#2449](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2449)).

For consistency with other `Platform` class methods, `Platform.recordingsDir` may be used instead of `thisProcess.platform.recordingsDir` ([#2877](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2877)).

`SequenceableCollection` has two new instance methods: `flatten2` and `flatBelow` ([#2527](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2527)). Additionally, `flatten` is faster now.

The `~callback` function is now available for all `Event` types instead of just "on" events ([#2376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2376)).

Event types now include a `parentEvent`, which provides default values. ([#3021](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3021)).

New aliases for done actions, e.g. `Done.freeSelf == 2`, are introduced for better readability ([#2616](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2616)). See the `Done` helpfile for details.

A new class, `Recorder`, allows recording independently of the `Server` object ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).

`SequenceableCollection:reduce` supports an adverb argument ([#2863](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2863)).

A `recordingsDir` method has been added directly to `Platform`, which transparently calls `thisProcess.platform.recordingsDir` ([#2877](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2877)).

`View:-resizeToBounds`, `View:-resizeToHint`, and `Window:-resizeToHint` were added to make it easier to force Views and Windows to automatically resize ([#2865](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2865)).

`Maybe` now supports collection methods `at`, `atAll`, `put`, `putAll`, `add`, `addAll` ([#2437](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2437)).

`BusPlug:-play` can now accept a `Bus` object ([#2845](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2845)).

Breadcrumb links in helpfiles now have separate links for each node in the hierarchy, and pages with multiple categories have separators between the categories ([#2916](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2916)).

`SoundFile:*openWrite` now takes additional parameters ([#2926](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2926)).

Two new instance methods were added to Symbol: `isBinaryOp` and `isIdentifier` ([#2955](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2955)).

Added three convenience methods: `View:resizeToBounds`, `View:resizeToHint`, and `Window:resizeToHint` ([#2865](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2865)).

Added `Collection:asEvent` for easy conversion to an `Event` ([#2871](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2871)).

`DeprecatedError` now shows you the file path of the deprecated method ([#3039](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3039)).

Added two new methods to `SimpleNumber`: `snap` and `softRound` ([#3160](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3160)).

`ReadableNodeIDAllocator` offers a new optional replacement for `PowerOfTwoAllocator` that assigns node IDs in a way more readable to humans when working with multiclient setups ([#3179](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3179)).

A new "booted" stage has been added to Server objects that have been booted but
may not be running yet, accessible via `Server:hasBooted` and
`Server.allBootedServers`
([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).

Class library: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** Rests in the patterns system have been restructured ([#2802](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2802)). Instead of using the `isRest` event property, events are considered rests if one of their properties is a `Rest` object. You must use instances of `Rest` rather than the rest class itself -- use of `Rest` instead of `Rest()` is now deprecated.

**Breaking change:** Fixed `Dictionary:==` only comparing the values of the two dictionaries, not the keys ([#2737](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2737)).

**Breaking change:** Fixed a mistake where `Pen.quadCurveTo` used the primitive for a cubic Bézier instead of quadratic ([#2553](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2553)). To restore the old behavior, change `Pen.quadCurveTo` to `Pen.curveTo`.

**Breaking change:** The convenience instance methods `Env:kr` and `Env:ar` had the arguments `mul` and `add` renamed to `levelScale` and `levelBias`, since they don't behave like typical `mul` and `add` arguments ([#2866](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2866)).

`Collection:processRest` returns the processed collection rather than the original ([#2497](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2497)).

The maximum number of MIDI ports has been increased ([#2494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2494)).

Attempting to use a control-rate signal as an input to `Hasher.ar` now results in an error ([#2589](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2589)).

The "Cleaning up temp synthdefs..." post message is suppressed if there is nothing to clean up ([#2629](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2629)).

To match `Out` and `ReplaceOut`, `LocalOut` and `XOut` now correctly validate their input, checking for a non-zero number of channels ([#2659](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2657), [#2659](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2659)).

The argument to `Pattern:fin` has a default of 1 for consistency with `Object:fin` ([#2480](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2840/files)).

`Complex:reciprocal` is faster now ([#2890](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2890)).

`Buffer:write` takes floating point arguments, truncating them to integers ([#2547](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2547)).

Conversion methods among collection types has been improved and documented ([#2871](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2871)).

`clientID` is now protected from being changed while the server is running
([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).

Class library: Deprecated
----------

`OSCresponder`, `OSCresponderNode`, and `OSCpathResponder` now emit deprecation messages, and will be removed after at least a year ([#2870](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2870)). Use `OSCFunc` or `OSCdef` instead.

`Speech` is deprecated ([#2424](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2424)), and will be removed in 3.10. The rationale is that its audio output is independent of the server (severely limiting use in compositions), it depends on a proprietary macOS API with no prospect of cross-platform compatibility, and it is too niche to justify inclusion in the core library.

The WiiMote classes (`WiiMote`, `WiiMoteIRObject`, `WiiCalibrationInfo`, `WiiMoteGUI`, `WiiRemoteGUI`, `WiiNunchukGUI`) are deprecated ([#2698](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2698)). They never reached a stable state and have gone unmaintained and unused for years.

`AudioIn` is deprecated and will be removed in some future version ([#2482](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2482)). It was provided only for backward compatibility with SC2, so its deprecation is long overdue. Use `SoundIn` instead.

`SplayZ` has been deprecated for a long time, but it's finally on the "official" deprecation track and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2631](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2631)). Use `SplayAz` instead.

`TDuty_old` has been deprecated for a long time, but it now emits a warning and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2677](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2677)). Use `TDuty` instead.

`Watcher` is an old alias for `SkipJack` provided for backward compatibility. It is officially deprecated and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2700](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2700)).

`Server:recordNode` is deprecated. Use `Recorder:recordNode` instead (e.g. `s.recorder.recordNode`) ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).

The `Server.set` class variable is deprecated. Use `Server.all` instead ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).

`SimpleNumber:quantize` is deprecated. Use `SimpleNumber:snap` instead ([#3160](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3160)).

`Server:userSpecifiedClientID` is deprecated. Use `Server:clientID` instead
([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).

Class library: Removed
-------

Removed non-functional stub methods and classes related to Image: the classes ImageFilter and ImageKernel, and the Image instance methods lockFocus, unlockFocus, applyFilters, filters, filteredWith, addFilter, removeFilter, flatten, invert, crop, applyKernel ([#2867](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2867)).

`Module`, an unmaintained and unused class for serialization of Synths, has been moved to a quark ([#2703](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2703)).

Removed the `openHelpFile` instance methods of `Object`, `String`, `Method`, and `Quark`. These methods have been deprecated since 3.8.

Removed `String:openTextFile` and `Symbol:openTextFile`. Use `String:openDocument` and `Symbol:openTextFile` instead. These methods have been deprecated since 3.8.

Class library: Fixed
-----

A number of instance methods in `Buffer` and `Bus` did not properly check to see if the object has already been freed, and would act on buffer #0 or bus #0 (which is especially dangerous for the `free` instance method). They now safeguard against this case and throw errors ([#2936](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2936), [#2960](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2960), [#2993](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2993)).

The `useRanger` option in `EnvirGui` broke in 3.7. This has been fixed ([#2418](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2418)).

`IdentityDictionary` methods `collect`, `select`, and `reject` retain references to the `parent` and `proto` objects ([#2507](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2507)).

On Linux, some MIDI methods created method override warnings. These have been silenced ([#2717](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2717)).

The "key" argument to `Pn` was not properly set on the first repeat. This has been fixed ([#2833](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2833)).

Fixed errors when using a DragSource inside a CompositeView object ([#2804](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2804)).

Fixed an interpreter crash when defining a SynthDef whose name is too long ([#2821](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2821)). More specifically, the inputs to `UnixFILE:putPascalString` and `CollStream:putPascalString` are now validated.

Server crashes are better handled by the interpreter ([#2453](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2453)).

The time display and the "start recording", "pause recording", and "stop recording" menu items now cooperate better with running `Server:record`, `Server:pauseRecording`, and `Server:stopRecording` ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).

`Server:makeGui` and `Server:makeWindow` broke in 3.8 — the fields in the windows went blank. They are working again ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).

A timing error with `NodeProxy:-clear` was fixed ([#2845](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2845)).

`SoundFileView` correctly displays its grid and does not draw the grid on top of the selection box ([#2872](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2872)).

The macOS plist file now shows the full version number for both the Version String and Shortened Version String ([#2487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2487)).

Fixed instances of accidentally silencing error messages caused by neglecting to call `Object:primitiveFailed` ([#2908](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2908)).

Patched the possibility of inconsistent `TempoClock` state when the tempo is set via `setTempoAtSec` ([#2078](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2078)).

Fixed memory spikes when using `MIDIFunc.sysex` with a large `srcID` ([#3005](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3005)).

Fixed spaces sometimes being rendered as `%20` in links in SCDoc ([#3033](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3033)).

Fixed `Function:plot` showing an empty graph if the server wasn't booted when the method was invoked ([#3047](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3047)).

Fixed blatant errors in `Collection:asAssociations` and `Collection:asPairs` where elements were dropped ([#3101](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3101)).

Fixed bugs in `NodeProxy` when using external servers ([#3103](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3103)).

`History` now outputs a correct timestamp on Windows ([#3045](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3045)).

Fixed Volume control failing to be persistent when rebooting the server ([#3125](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3125)).

Fixed `SimpleNumber:asTimeString` producing nonsensical results with the "precision" argument ([#3166](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3166)).

`Server:clientID` can now be changed, allowing multiple clients connect to the same server ([#3178](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3178)).

History and HistoryGui have been cleaned up
([#3267](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3267)).

Fixed duplicate node IDs involving `Server.initTree`
([#3265](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3265)).

Fixed supernova crashing when too many controls are used
([#3196](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3196)).

`Volume` now respects lag time when it is instantiated or destroyed
([#3332](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3332)).

IDE & SCDoc: Added
-----

Entries in the Documents docklet can be reordered, and document tabs will automatically reorder to reflect this ([#2555](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2555)).

"Edit > Preferences > Editor > Display" has a new option that allows replacing tabs with a dropdown whose items are alphabetically ordered ([#2555](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2555)). This makes navigation easier in some performance contexts.

IDE & SCDoc: Changed
-------

Server actions, which were previously in the "Language" menu, have been moved out to their own "Server" menu ([#3049](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3049)).

Changed "occurrences" to "matches" in the status bar in the Find and Replace features ([#2702](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2702)).

Many minor improvements were made to the look and feel of the documentation ([#2944](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2944), [#2945](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2945), [#2947](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2947), [#2948](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2948), [#2967](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2967), [#3006](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3006), [#3022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3022), [#3025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3025), [#3034](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3034), [#3175](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3175), [#3346](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3346)).

IDE & SCDoc: Fixed
-----

Fixed SCDoc refusing to index any further documents if one document has a malformed `copymethod::` command ([#3050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3050)).

Some Linux systems had unreadable font colors in the autocomplete tooltips. This has been (finally) fixed ([#2672](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2762)).

Fixed a bug where `Document:selectedString_` had no effect ([#2849](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2849)).

New tabs are now inserted to the right of the current tab instead of all the way at the end ([#3053](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3053)).

The help browser now has keyboard shortcuts for navigating back and forward ([#3056](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3056)). These shortcuts are OS-dependent and given to us by [Qt](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.9/qkeysequence.html#standard-shortcuts).

Fixed the "Find in page..." feature in the help viewer skipping every other occurrence ([#2903](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2903)).

Fixed HTML checkboxes appearing in the upper left of the help viewer ([#3028](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3028)).

Fixed the right-click menu for the tabs appearing in the wrong place in macOS ([#3042](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3042)).

## [3.7.2](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/tree/3.7.2) (2016-06-03)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/compare/Version-3.7.1...Version-3.7.2)

This patch release fixes the Windows including MIDI. HID is still not quite working on Windows. Many thanks to: @bagong and @llloret

SC VIM is now a git submodule. This affects mainly developers. VIM support can be installed as per the documentation - nothing has changed in how you use it.  We changed this in 3.7.2 as well as on master (3.8 development) so that switching back and forth between branches wouldn't be super annoying.

**Fixes:**

- Midi not working on Windows [\#1922](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/1922)
- Windows: opening SC via system registered document types faulty [\#2022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2022)
