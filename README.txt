Welcome to SuperCollider 3!
***************************

SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It provides an interpreted object-oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the art, realtime sound synthesis server.

SuperCollider was written by James McCartney (audiosynth.com) over a period of many years. It is now an open source GPL'd project maintained and developed by James and various others. It is used by musicians, scientists, and artists working with sound.

This README is a first help for anyone new to SuperCollider. There are many good resources available for learning SuperCollider, with up to date links from the site listed above, including links to forums and mailing lists. The SuperCollider IDE now provides a new help system which can be invoked by the key combinations CTRL+D (on Linux, Windows) or CMD+D (on OS X) to get started. 
The exact details of using the SuperCollider environment will depend on your platform. Some immediate comments:

1) Since version 3.6 SuperCollider consists of three main components: a sound synthesiser (the audio Server), a programming language (the Language interpreter) and the code editor.
When using SC (SuperCollider) from within the developer environment, the SC Server is used automatically for sound synthesis as long as it's turned on! This is accomplished by pressing the 'Boot' button on the Server window (until version 3.5.x), clicking 'Boot Server' in the 'Language' menu of the new editor or running the code 's.boot'. Further details can be found in the help tutorials; but this is just to remember you in case you're impatient and can't understand why you're not immediately getting sounds.
2) The Main Help page in SuperCollider gives some immediate key commands and should give you a good start navigating the help system. Please also check the different menu options available with the application on your system.
