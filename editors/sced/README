    This is Sced, a SuperCollider interaction plugin for gedit.

    Sced aims to simplify SuperCollider experience on Linux systems
    as far as possible.

Installation
============

1. Get the Sced tarball and unpack it.

2. Put the data/supercollider.lang file in any of these folders:

    * /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs
    * $HOME/.gnome2/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs

3. Put the data/supercollider.xml file in any of these folders:

    * /usr/share/mime/packages
    * $HOME/.local/share/mime/packages

4. Run update-mime-database with the appropriate folder, i.e.:

    $ update-mime-database $HOME/.local/share/mime

5. Place BOTH data/sced.gedit-plugin file and sced/ folder
   into either of these folders:

    * /usr/lib/gedit-2/plugins
    * $HOME/.gnome2/gedit/plugins

6. Activate Sced from the gedit preferences dialog.
   Make sure to click "Configure plugin" and select a proper runtime folder
   (also create a folder, named "synthdefs" inside the runtime folder).

Steps 2 to 4 are only required if you want syntax highlighting. Also, be aware
that if you start your code with comments (both // and /**/), gedit might think
that it's C code (due to a magic pattern in the shared-mime-info package).

Step 6 is only required for older SuperCollider versions.

Usage
=====

The menu items describe themselves. You're going to use the Ctrl+E shortcut
a lot. By default, this command evaluates the current line of code. If you
select several lines, hitting Ctrl+E will evaluate them all.

You can also select and run a ()-block. Just place the cursor on the opening
bracket and press Ctrl+E, i. e.:

( // press Ctrl+E here
"hello".postln;
"world".postln;
);
