REQUIREMENTS:
- vim
- supercollider (sclang)
- ruby
- cmake

OPTIONAL:
- gvim or MacVim
________________________________________________________________________________

INSTALLATION STEPS:

Note:  If you installed SuperCollider from source and didn't disable scvim when
running cmake, scvim should already be installed.

If you'd like to install scvim directly, without using the whole SuperCollider
install process you can do:

cmake . && sudo make install

You will have to enter your password in order to finalize the installation.

some people prefer to use a build directory [though scvim doesn't actually
build anything, but cmake does create some output files] to do that, from the
scvim directory, type:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && sudo make install

Now you should be ready to use scvim, e.g. by running "scvim" or "scvim -g" from
a command prompt.
________________________________________________________________________________

OPTIONAL EXTRA INSTALLATION STEPS:

* If you want to be able to read supercollider files with syntax highlighting,
   have the ability to start the language and have the keybindings you've set
   up during a normal vim editing session [without launching as 'scvim'] then
   source your scvimrc file in your ~/.vimrc
   for example, if you have a ~/.scvimrc file you could put this line in your ~/.vimrc
   so ~/.scvimrc

* I put this in my ~/.sclang.sc so that each time I start sclang I have updated
   Object completion and highlighting, as well as Object Definition Lookup:
   //set up the scvim stuff
   SCVim.updateCaches;
   You'll probably want to execute this at least once after an install of
   supercollider to get the most up-to-date Object info

* sclang's working directory defaults to /tmp on linux and
   /Applications/SuperCollider on mac when using scvim. If you want to
   set it to something else you can set the bash environment variable
   SCLANG_RUNDIR

* I've put the colorscheme that I use in the "extra" folder.  This makes
   strings, symbols and chars variations on the same color but all look
   different.  Feel free to use/modify it to your liking.

USAGE:

defaults (most work in both command and insert mode):

:SClangStart starts/restarts the interpreter in an xterm
  (if you want to recompile the supercollider library just type :SClangStart and you'll
   kill the current interpreter, start up a new one and have a recompiled library)
:SClangKill
   kills the xterm/interpreter
(exiting vim also kills the interpreter)

F5 sends a whole block (looks for the outermost parens and sends that data)
F6 sends a single line (the line the cursor is currently on)
F7 calls TempoClock.default.clear;
F8 calls s.freeAll;
F12 calls thisProcess.stop; (i.e. the same as cmd-. on Mac)

in visual mode F5 and F6 both send the whole visual block

use :SChelp to get to SC help topics, or use K on a word (in command mode)
   (this has tab completion)
use :SCdef to see the class definitions for an object, or use ^k (in command or normal mode)
   on a word (this also has tab completion)

These key bindings can all be changed through editing your scvimrc file.

HELP DOCS:

scvim uses preprocessed versions of the help files (converted to plain-text),
and to update these help files from the main files you can run the following
line in sclang:

  SCVim.updateHelpCache;


TROUBLE SHOOTING:

If you cannot find the scvim executable, make sure that "/usr/local/bin" is in
your PATH, this is where scvim is installed by default.

If you get errors about _FileWrite (like the error printed below) when you run
SCVim.updateHelpCache or SCVim.updateCaches it is likely that you don't have
write permissions for your scvim_cache_dir.
This directory is normally: ~/.scvim/
You can verify that by executing: SCVIM.scvim_cache_dir
Most often the solution is to do this: sudo chown -R <yourusername> ~/.scvim/

ERROR: Primitive '_FileWrite' failed.
Failed.

Dan Stowell for his help:
   converting the SuperCollider code into a class, improving the README, getting scvim
   into the SuperCollider svn, etc.
John Yates for providing the indent functionality [which I have changed slightly] and
   help with the help file processor
