SuperCollider class library, help files, sclang and scsynth
HAS BEEN MOVED into SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources.

In previous versions of SuperCollider, these resources lived in the
top folder next to SuperCollider.app. To make a standard self-contained
app bundle with correct library linking, these have now been moved into
the app bundle.

If you need to access them from the Finder, ctrl-click SuperCollider.app
and choose "Show package contents" from the context menu.

To access them in the Terminal, simply:

  $ cd path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources

To have sclang and scsynth available system-wide, you can put wrapper-
scripts into a folder in your PATH, like /usr/local/bin
For sclang:

  #!/bin/sh
  cd /full/path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources
  exec ./sclang $*

And for scsynth:

  #!/bin/sh
  cd /full/path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources
  exec ./scsynth $*

NOTE: Why not symlinking them instead? Because:
- If you have Qt installed system-wide, sclang will complain that
  Qt frameworks are loaded twice.
- scsynth will not find the included "plugins", unless given explicitly
  with the -U commandline flag.

Happy supercolliding!
