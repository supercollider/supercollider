This file lists bigger/noteworthy changes, only...

Version 1.0 (upcoming)
dyncall:
  o PPC64 single-precision float fixes for more than 13 float args (thanks Masanori Mitsugi!)
  o fixed potential buffer overrun on ARM64
  o error code handling (dcGetError) changes, flag is now cleared (work still underway)

dyncallback:
  o PPC64 single-precision float fixes for more than 13 float args (thanks Masanori Mitsugi!)
  o MIPS o32 (big- and little-endian), EABI (32 bit, little-endian) and n64 (big-endian) support
  o SPARC32 (v7/v8) support
  o SPARC64 (v9) support
  o PPC32 fixes for (old) Darwin/OS X systems
  o POSIX compliance: fallback for wx alloc on systems that don't have mmap()'s MAP_ANON
  o allocated space used for thunk now always W^X (req. for e.g. OpenBSD >= 6.0)
dynload:
  o major reliability/stability fixes for Mach-O dlSyms* functions to (thanks Stéphane Mons for help):
    better handle loading dylibs by symlink, relative path, random casing, etc.
    fixes to symbol name lookups that used wrong offsets before
    64-bit platform fixes (was broken on x64 and never supported on others)
  o allowing Mach-O dlSyms* lib to be used standalone (consistent with ELF and PE impls now)
  o simplifications of implemention on Darwin, sharing parts with *nix implementation
  o potentially breaking change on macos/Darwin platforms: all functions now consistently accept or
    return symbol names as they would appear in C code, instead of the raw ones in object files
  o added new function dlGetLibraryPath, allowing lookups of path to library via handle
general:
  o assembly code now built by explicitily asking for non-execstack, for safer/easier integration
    into other projects/builds, where needed; needed b/c of questionable default behaviours of some
    toolchains (thanks Thorsten Behrens for report and analysis)
