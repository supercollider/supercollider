Welcome to SuperCollider!
=========================

**SuperCollider** is an environment and programming language for real time audio
synthesis and algorithmic composition. It provides an interpreted
object-oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the
art, realtime sound synthesis server.

SuperCollider was written by James McCartney (http://audiosynth.com) over a period of
many years. It is now an open source GPL'd project maintained and developed by
James and various others. It is used by musicians, scientists, and artists
working with sound.

This README is a first help for anyone new to SuperCollider. There are many
good resources available for learning SuperCollider, with up to date links from
the site listed above, including links to forums and mailing lists.


Usage
-----

SuperCollider consists of three separate components:

1. scsynth - audio engine (the "server")
2. sclang - programming language runtime interpreter including Qt graphical user interfaces
3. IDE (integrated development environment) - an editor for writing code and running supercollider

To begin using SuperCollider, you usually start up the IDE:

- on Mac OS this is `SuperCollider.app`
- on Linux and Windows, this is the `scide` executable

You can get further help by using the IDE's integrated help
system which can be invoked via the "Help" menu or using the key combination
`Ctrl+D` (on Linux, Windows) or `Cmd+D` (on Mac OS). In the Help menu, you will
also find an action that will take you directly to the help page on using the
IDE.

When starting the SuperCollider IDE, the audio server is not started
automatically. You can start it using the "Language > Boot Server" menu action,
or using the key combination `Ctrl+B` (on Linux, Windows) or `Cmd+B` (on Mac OS).
This is just to remind you in case you're impatient and can't understand why
you're not immediately getting sound.

We suggest you to proceed by reading the tutorials available in the help
system. Please note that some help pages are not up-to-date with the latest
development of SuperCollider, especially when mentioning the code editing
environment. Regarding this, it is best to refer to the help page specifically
about the new SuperCollider IDE.

Also, please explore the IDE menus, which will let you discover a lot of
functionality of the coding environment.

To get further information on SuperCollider usage or development, you should subscribe
to the mailing lists:

We hope you enjoy SuperCollider; please get involved in the active community!
