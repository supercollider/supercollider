To write, use and develop UnitTests, you need to 

list::
## install a sourcecode version of SuperCollider
## change your environment to include only core library functionality
## run UnitTests
::


section:: install a sourcecode version of SuperCollider


downloads or clones SuperCollider from github: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.
It is not needed to compile SuperCollider from its sources, you can instead use a pre-compiled binary and include the relevant folders (code::SCClassLibrary, HelpSource, testsuite/classlibrary:: in your environment. See below for an example.


section:: Change your environment to include only core library functionality


In order to mimick the standard SuperCollider installation, make sure that you have only the class library installed. 

Best practise is to create a separate code::.yaml:: configuration file that resides parallel to the default one. You can do this either interactively from within the preferences of your IDE (code::Preferences>Interpreter::), or programatically

code::
~sclangConf = "SCLANG_CONF".getenv;
LanguageConfig.addIncludePath(~scSourceDir +/+ "testsuite/classlibrary");
+   LanguageConfig.addExcludePath(~scSourceDir +/+ "testsuite/classlibrary/server");
+   LanguageConfig.addExcludePath(Quarks.folder +/+ "UnitTesting/tests");
+   postf("Writing configuration to %\n", ~sclangConf);
+   LanguageConfig.store(~sclangConf);

section:: Organisation


Core class code::UnitTest::s are located in the directory
1.  UnitTests go into parrallel directory
2.  server-related tests go into `server` subdir
3.  UnitTests should use assert and assertFloat
4.  look at existing UnitTests to understand what are good UnitTests
5.  UnitTest setup
8.  run UnitTests either automatically (code::UnitTest.runAll::), interactively (code::UnitTEst.gui::), or individually by class (code::MyClass.test / TestMyClass.run << synonyms::)


section:: Writing new tests


The simplest way is to look at an existing help file or class document, and read this document and link::Reference/SCDocSyntax::
