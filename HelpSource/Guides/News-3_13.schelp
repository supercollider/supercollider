Welcome to the SuperCollider 3.13 release! 

note::
In this version numerous UGens have been fixes so that they calculate their initial value as originally intended. In some cases this may create a different result than previously. See below for details.
::

We now also provide a universal build for both x86_64 and arm64 Apple machines.

Below you can find a more complete list of changes in this version. A big thank you to all developers for your contributions!

section:: UGens: Added


Argument code:: binout :: to code:: SpecPcile :: by @woolgathering in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5097


section:: UGens: Changed


code:: Impulse :: is now initialized correctly such that:

list::
##it will fire on the first sample, given the default phase of 0 (or multiple of 1).
##a frequency of 0 fires once and only once on the first sample (unless the frequency subsequently changes).
##negative frequencies and phases are now supported and phase of any value is wrapped into range.
::

These are intended and documented behaviors, but which failed previously in certain UGen configurations. Therefore, users may observe changes to the initial state of synth graphs that use Impulse. (Especially triggered UGens.) For details, a list of resolved/changed behavior can be found here.

For more details see https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4150 by @mtmccrea

Numerous UGens have been updated so that their initialization sample is set correctly by @mtmccrea: 
code:: OscUGens :: in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5787, 
code:: Klang :: and code:: Klank :: in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5817, 
code:: TWindex :: in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5815,
code:: Free :: and code:: PauseSelf :: in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5914,
code::Poll:: in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5965
.

code:: Integrator :: Ctor passes through the first sample only by @jamshark70 in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5352. Prior to v3.13, there was a bug that caused the Integrator to double-count the initial value: the integral of a single 1 followed by endless 0s ends up being 2. Starting with v.3.13, it's 1 as expected.

code:: PanAz ::, due to fixing leaks and imprecisions by @elgiano in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4971


section:: UGens: Fixed


code:: Tap :: samplerate compensation by @morfant in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5606

code:: AudioControl :: and code:: InFeedback :: processing for an extra cycle by @vitreo12 in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5601

Remove RTAlloc exceptions, and review all plugins' RTAlloc/RTFree by @elgiano in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5713
