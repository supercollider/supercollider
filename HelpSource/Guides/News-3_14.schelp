section:: Notable changes and additions

These are the highlights of the changes in SC 3.14. See sections below for details.

list::
## Sclang functions now support collecting arbitrary keyword arguments via code:: **kwargs ::
## The initialization sample of multiple UGens was fixed
## Documentation can now also be themed like the IDE
## Due to updated bundled boost libraries, FluCoMa UGens which were working under SuperCollider 3.13 are not compatible anymore with 3.14! Go to link::https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-sc to check:: for compatible version.
## Even though these are not as much of user-facing changes, there were countless structural upgrades: we migrated to qt6, added and improved tests, updated 3rd-party libraries, updated the build system for most recent build tools, and adapted a new organizational structure for development

section:: Breaking Changes

list::
## Phasor: fix init sample: don't ignore trig on first sample. If code relied on this bug, it may change behavior. by @elgiano in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6833
## fix code:: mod :: for negative integer modulus (only). The method code:: modSeaside :: can be used to restore the original behavior, named this way for reasons not immediately obvious, by @passyur and @telephon  https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6699
## code:: Splay :: and code:: SplayAz :: level compensation has been fixed and made more flexible, this may change overall level distribution, by @adcxyz https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6804.
## mark code:: SetResetFF :: explicitly as unipolar, this changes output levels when using code:: range :: â€“ e.g. if you have used code:: .range(0, 1) ::, it had assumed bipolar default so far and returned a range of code:: [0.5, 1] ::.) by @capital-G in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6023
## code:: Set.remove :: now returns the item removed by @JordanHendersonMusic in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6409
## fix Dictionary code:: trueAt :: by @telephon in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6001, and @mtmccrea in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6335 This changes behavior as follows:

section:: General

subsection:: Added

So far, additional function and method arguments could be captured into an array via the syntax: code:: f = { |a, b ... args| args }; f.(1,2,3,4) // returns [3, 4] ::. It was not possible to use other keywords than those explicitly given (here code:: a :: and code:: b ::) Now we can also capture arbitrary keyword arguments, via the syntax: code:: f = { |a, b ... args, kwargs| kwargs }; f.(x:3, y:4) // returns [\x, 3, \y, 4] ::.

The new keyword argument capture was implemented  by @JordanHendersonMusic in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6339, in collaboration with @telephon and @capital-G.

This change makes a number of new things possible, e.g.

list::
## code:: performList ::, code:: functionPerformList ::, code:: superPerform ::, code:: tryPerform ::, code:: doesNotUnderstand :: take kwargs now. This makes message forwarding more flexible and more complete.
## A new code:: superPerformArgs :: method was necessary to avoid an infinite loop in passing keyword arguments up to the parent class, by @JordanHendersonMusic in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6568
## keywords in code:: *newCopyArgs :: allow for cleaner constructors in classes with many instance variables, you can now write expressions like code:: ^super.newCopyArgs(freq:440) :: by @JordanHendersonMusic in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6398
## keyword arguments now work for composed and higher order functions (code:: Maybe ::, code:: CallOnce ::, code:: UnaryOpFunction ::, code:: BinaryOpFunction ::, code:: NaryOpFunction ::, code:: FunctionList ::, code:: UnaryOpFunctionProxy ::, code:: BinaryOpFunctionProxy ::, code:: NAryOpFunctionProxy ::), so e.g. you can write code:: f = { |x, y = 1| x + y } * { |x, y = 2| x ** y }; f.(x:2, y:6) :: by @telephon in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6786
## a new method for all objects which passes keyword arguments as a list explicitly: code:: performArgs(selector, args, kwargs) ::
## methods on code:: FunctionDef :: for finding out their argument form: code:: varArgsValue ::, code:: hasVarArgs ::, code:: hasKwArgs ::.
## passing arguments to Scale and Tuning selectors works now: code:: Scale.ionian(tuning:Tuning.kirnberger) :: (this was the original problem to be solved).
## Object prototyping: pseudo-methods in code:: IdentityDictionary :: take keyword arguments and pass them on correctly. So you can write now: code:: u = (dive:{|self, speed, depth| ... }); u.dive(depth: -5) ::
## code:: DoesNotUnderstandError :: informs about keyword arguments.
## Make code:: Pbind :: work with kwargs (this syntax works now: code:: Pbind(note: Pseq([-3, -2, 0, 1, 6, 13]), dur: 0.05, amp: 0.1).play ::) by @JordanHendersonMusic and @telephon in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/6530
