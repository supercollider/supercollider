Please do not hesitate to add new issues you find to the LINK::https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues##issue tracker:: or mention them on any of the supercollider LINK::http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/supercollider/mailinglist.aspx##mailing list::.::

This document focusses on features, there are STRONG::many bugfixes and interesting improvements::, which can be found by exploring the recent changes file and snooping around the system itself.


SECTION:: Editor

LIST::
##Menu entries for Recording, scope and server inspection
##Modify and query IDE documents from sclang
##Support for the Atom text editor
::

SECTION:: Language-side news

LIST::
##Improved link::Classes/Quark:: system and many new interesting Quarks.
##LINK::Classes/TempoClock#-beats:: can be set.
##An interface for key-value-pairs, see link::Reference/Key-Value-Pairs::
##Refactored JITLib, see link::Other/JITLibChanges3.7:: (in particular dynamic channel expansion).
##LINK::Classes/QuartzComposerView::
::


SUBSECTION::External Interfacing

There is an entirely new HID implementation: see link::Guides/Working_with_HID::.


SUBSECTION::List of new methods and classes

LIST::
##link::Classes/Collection#-collectCopy::, link::Classes/Collection#-collectInPlace::
##link::Classes/SimpleNumber#-lcm:: and link::Classes/SimpleNumber#-gcd:: have consistent interpretations of negative values and zero.
##link::Classes/Dictionary#-embedInStream:: can be customized from within the dictionary.
##link::Classes/Server#*remote:: Create a new Server instance corresponding to a server app running on a separate machine.
::

SUBSECTION::List of deprecated methods/classes, or that will be deprecated soon
LIST::
##GeneralHID, GeneralHIDSpec, GeneralHIDDevice (replaced by the new LINK::Classes/HID:: system)
::



SECTION::Server-side news

Apart from UDP, the TCP-protocol is now supported.

When mapping controls of synths to busses, their number of channels is limited to the number of control channels, avoiding a "spill-over" of mappings.

SUBSECTION::List of new UGens

LIST::
##NodeID (UGen that returns the current node id)
##LINK::Classes/Dconst::
::

SUBSECTION::Improved or corrected behavior
LIST::
##LINK::Classes/LinXFade2:: (correct fading direction)
##LINK::Classes/LFPulse:: (when width = 0.5, return exacly as many 0 as 1)
##LINK::Classes/TrigControl:: is now independent of synth order, like LINK::Classes/Control::.
##LINK::Classes/TRand::, LINK::Classes/TExpRand::, LINK::Classes/TIRand:: (can operate at audio rate)
##LINK::Classes/Env#*new:: accepts a new TELETYPE::step2:: shape, which steps to a value at the end of a shape
##LINK::Classes/UGen#-curvelin:: is now inverse of LINK::Classes/UGen#-lincurve::
##LINK::Classes/Server#-record:: correcty closes short files
##In combinations of demand-ugens: Instances of PV_Copy are added automatically where necessary for parallel processing
::


SUBSECTION::More operators work uniformly across sclang and scserver

The following operators have been added as ugens and work the same as in sclang:

TABLE::
##unary operators || code::rand, rand2, linrand, bilinrand, sum3rand, coin::

##binary operators || code::lcm, gcd, rrand, exprand::
::

See link::Overviews/Operators::
