subsection:: More informative syntax errors
The parser now posts the details of syntax errors, example:
code::
[1,2,%,4];
123;
::
Posts the following error message:
teletype::
ERROR: syntax error, unexpected BINOP, expecting ']'
  in file 'selected text'
  line 1 char 6:

  [1,2,%,4];
       ^
  123;
-----------------------------------
ERROR: Command line parse failed

subsection:: Remove old syntax
code::#(a:1):: was valid syntax, but yielded nonsense results. This will now result in a syntax error instead.

subsection:: New SCDoc parser and renderer
SCDoc has been rewritten and the parser is now implemented in C++ for speed and stability.
The syntax has gotten stricter, and it will throw errors or warnings if there are faults in the documentation.

Some important changes to keep in mind:
list::
## Linking to sections does no longer use lower_case_and_underscored anchors, but the exact section title as it is. Example: teletype::link\::#Language-side news\:::: renders: link::#Language-side news::
## Run code::SCDoc.indexAllDocuments:: if you add a new document or other file and want to see the change reflected in the help. If you just changed a document and want to see the changes, just press Reload in the browser and SCDoc will detect and re-index automatically.
## The teletype::CLASS\:::: tag is deprecated, just use teletype::TITLE\:::: instead even for class reference docs.

subsection:: YAML/JSON parser
link::Classes/String#-parseYAML:: and link::Classes/String#-parseYAMLFile:: can be used to parse YAML or JSON.
