INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: window
Get a reference to the link::Classes/Window:: of this ServerView

returns:: a link::Classes/Window:: reference

METHOD:: meterView
Get a reference to the link::Classes/ServerMeterView:: of this ServerView

returns:: a link::Classes/ServerMeterView:: reference

note::
A ServerMeter encapsulates both a link::Classes/Window:: and a link::Classes/ServerMeterView:: within that Window. For more information about Windows and views see link::Guides/GUI-Introduction#Basic elements: Windows, views and containers::
