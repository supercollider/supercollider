description::

warning::
has been rewritten and renamed link::Classes/PdefGui::, which has largely the same functionality, but is more consistent and more flexible. There are some changes to the strong::*new:: method:

definitionList::
## instead of || *new(px, nVars, height, width, parent, makeWatcher)
## PdefGui uses || *new (object, numItems, parent, bounds, extras)
::

strong::px:: is now strong::object::, strong::nVars:: is now strong::numItems::, strong::width & height:: can be put as strong::bounds: height @ width ::, strong::parent:: is still strong::parent::, strong::makeWatcher:: is now strong::makeSkip:: .

Please see link::Classes/PdefGui:: for more details.
