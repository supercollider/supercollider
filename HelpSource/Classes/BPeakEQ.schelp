description::
The B equalization suite is based on the Second Order Section (link::Classes/SOS::) biquad UGen.

note::
Biquad coefficient calculations imply certain amount of CPU overhead. These plugin UGens contain optimizations such that the coefficients get updated only when there has been a change to one of the filter's parameters. This can cause spikes in CPU performance and should be considered when using several of these units.
::

classmethods::

method:: ar
argument:: in
input signal to be processed.
argument:: freq
center frequency.
WARNING: due to the nature of its implementation frequency values close to 0 may cause glitches and/or extremely loud audio artifacts!
argument:: rq
the reciprocal of Q. bandwidth / cutoffFreq.
argument:: db
boost/cut the center frequency (in dBs).
argument:: mul
argument:: add

examples::
code::
s.boot;
(
z = { // toy with boost/cut
BPeakEQ.ar(
	SoundIn.ar([0, 1]),
	MouseX.kr(20, 20000, \exponential),
	0.8, // rq
	MouseY.kr(12.0, -12.0, \linear),
	0.5); // mul
}.play)
z.release;

(
z = { // toy with rq
BPeakEQ.ar(
	SoundIn.ar([0, 1]),
	MouseX.kr(20, 20000, \exponential),
	MouseY.kr(10, 0.4, \linear), // rq
	6, // boost/cut - +6dB
	0.5); // mul
}.play)
z.release;
