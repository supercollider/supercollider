Description::

Audio to control rate converter. Only needed in specific cases.
Use this if strictly necessary, as this turns out to consume some CPU.
in some cases it's just preferrable to use another UGen.
So, instead of using something like:

code::
{WhiteNoise.ar(A2K.kr(HenonC.ar(rrand(1, 30))) ! 2)}.scope
::

you could use something like:

code::
{WhiteNoise.ar(LFDNoise3.kr(rrand(1, 30)) ! 2)}.scope
::

classmethods::

method::kr

argument::in
The input signal.
