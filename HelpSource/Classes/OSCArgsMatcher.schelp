description::


OSCArgMatcher matches an argument template to a link::Classes/Function:: or similar object. When its value method is called, it evaluates the function if all of the arguments in its template pass a link::Reference/matchItem:: test.  This is used by link::Classes/OSCMessageDispatcher:: and link::Classes/OSCMessagePatternDispatcher:: to match incoming OSC messages to instances of link::Classes/OSCFunc:: or link::Classes/OSCdef:: using sender address. This class is private, and generally users should not need to address instances directly.


classmethods::


method::new

makes a new OSCArgsMatcher

argument::argTemplate
an link::Classes/Array:: comprising a template for determining if incoming arguments match. For each argument that you wish to test, you may include a constant (for exact matching), code::nil:: (indicating that all possible values and types will match), or a link::Classes/Function:: to test the incoming argument (see link::Reference/matchItem:: for examples). These should be in the same order as the items in the incoming OSC message, starting from index 1. (Index 0 is the OSC address.)

argument::func
a link::Classes/Function:: or similar object which will respond to the incoming message. When evaluated it will be passed the arguments msg, time, addr, and recvPort, corresponding to the message as an link::Classes/Array:: in the form code::[OSCAddress, ...otherArgs]::, the time that the message was sent, a link::Classes/NetAddr:: corresponding to the IP address of the sender, and an link::Classes/Integer:: corresponding to the port on which the message was received.


instancemethods::


private:: init


method::value

tests if an incoming message's arguments match, and if so evaluate this object's function. In normal usage (within an OSCFunc) this is done behind the scenes.

argument::testMsg
an link::Classes/Array:: in the form code::[OSCAddress, â€¦msgArgs]::.

argument::time
the time that the message was sent as a link::Classes/Float::.

argument::addr
a link::Classes/NetAddr:: corresponding to the IP address of the sender.

argument::recvPort
an link::Classes/Integer:: corresponding to the port on which the message was received.


examples::

code::
// Basic example (standalone use)
m = OSCArgsMatcher([1, nil, 2], { 'matches!'.postln });
m.value(['/myAddress', 1, 3, 2], 0.0, NetAddr.localAddr, NetAddr.langPort); // matches!
