CLASS:: Rest
summary:: Represents a rest in event patterns
categories:: Streams-Patterns-Events
related:: Classes/Pbind, Classes/Event

DESCRIPTION::
Rest may be used in event patterns to indicate that the resulting event should be a rest (i.e., silent). It should be used in one of the child patterns belonging to a Pbind, for instance.

subsection:: Expressing rests in event patterns

In addition to the Rest class, rests can be specified in two other ways (legacy usages).

list::
## A link::Classes/Symbol:: may be specified in any frequency stream (under the keys degree, note, midinote or freq). The exception to this rule is control bus mapping symbols, beginning with 'c' followed by a number. Typical symbols that have been used include strong::\rest::, strong::\r:: and the empty symbol strong:: \ ::.

code::
p = Pbind(
	\degree, Pseq([
		0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0,
		2, 3, 4, \rest, 2, 3, 4, \rest
	]),
	\dur, 0.25
).play;
::

## The event's strong::\type:: may be set to strong::\rest::.

code::
p = Pbind(
	\degree, Pseries(0, 1, inf).fold(-7, 7),
	\dur, 0.125,
	\type, Pwrand([\note, \rest], [0.9, 0.1], inf)
).play;

p.stop;
::
::

The Rest class allows rests to be indicated in any stream, not only frequency or event type. Also, using the duration argument (see the *new method below), rests may be embedded into a duration stream. That is, rests may be treated as part of the rhythmic specification, rather than the pitch specification.

subsection:: Usage

note::
As of SuperCollider 3.9, code::Rest::'s behavior has changed to be more intuitive.
::

list::
## link::Classes/Event#-isRest:: checks every item in the event to see if it meets the condition to be a rest: it may be a code::Rest:: instance, the code::Rest:: class, or either of the symbols code:: \ :: or code::\r::. If any item meets the condition, the event will be considered a rest and it will not take action when played.

## If a Pbind child pattern yields a Rest object, the Rest is placed directly into the event. This is a change of behavior from 3.8.

## If a Rest object has a value, it will respond to math operations: code::Rest(1) * 2 == Rest(2)::.

section:: How it works


CLASSMETHODS::
All methods of Rest except *new are private, and should not be used directly.

private:: processRest
private:: embedInStream
private:: asStream

METHOD:: new
Create an instance of Rest, with a value to be used in the resulting rest event.

argument:: value
The Rest instance's numeric value, to be used in math operations. Note that a Rest's value is ignored for most Event keys (assuming the Event does nothing in response to code::.play::). If a Rest appears in a rhythm key (code::dur:: or code::delta::), then the number is the time until the next event. Consequently, numeric Rests are often used for duration -- but there is no requirement that a Rest's value must be a duration.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

EXAMPLES::

Using the Rest class in a pitch stream

code::
p = Pbind(
	\degree, Pif(
		0.1.loop.coin,
		Rest,
		Pseries(0, 1, inf).fold(-7, 7)
	),
	\dur, 0.125
).play;

p.stop;
::

Using a Rest instance in a duration stream
code::
p = Pbind(
	\degree, Pseries(0, 1, inf).fold(-7, 7),
	\dur, Pseq([Pn(0.125, { rrand(3, 6) }), Rest(0.25)], inf)
).play;

p.stop;
