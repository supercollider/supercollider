title:: DoesNotUnderstandError
summary:: error thrown when calling an unknown method name
categories:: Core
related:: Classes/Error


description::


This error is typically generated when a method that doesn't exist on the receiver is called. Users typically do not
construct this object themselves. The object has a few getters to learn more about the call that caused the error.

This method reports a backtrace as well as a best-guess suggested replacement based on edit distance.


classmethods::


method::new

constructs a new DoesNotUnderstandError, and choose a possible suggested replacement based on the class of the
receiver and contents of the selector.

argument::receiver
the object on which the method was called.

argument::selector
the method name that was not understood.

argument::args
arguments passed to the unknown method.


instancemethods::


method::selector

returns::

the selector passed to new. Typically, the method name that was not understood.


method::args

returns::

the args passed to new. Typically, an array of arguments passed to the unknown method.


method::suggestedCorrection

returns::

if there is a method that the receiver would understand that looks similar to the unknown method name, the
the link::Classes/method::object that corresponds to it. Otherwise, code::nil::.


method::errorString

returns::

short-form representation of the error as a link::Classes/String::, with a suggested replacement if one was
found.


method::reportError

prints a long-form explanation of the error including backtrace and suggested replacement if one was found.
