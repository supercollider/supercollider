DESCRIPTION::
An OrderedIdentitySet is a collection of objects, no two of which are the same object (aka. "identical").
Most of its methods are inherited. (see link::Classes/Collection:: and link::Classes/Set:: classes).
Unlike link::Classes/IdentitySet::, contents of an OrderedIdentitySet are ordered.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

private::putCheck

method::do
Evaluates strong::function:: for each item in the OrderedIdentitySet. You may depend on the order of items. The function is passed two arguments, the item and an integer index.
code::
OrderedIdentitySet[1, 2, 3, 300].do { |item, i| item.postln };
