description::




An OrderedIdentitySet is a collection of objects, no two of which are the same object (aka. "identical").
Most of its methods are inherited.
(see link::Classes/Collection:: and link::Classes/Set:: classes).
Unlike link::Classes/IdentitySet::, contents of an OrderedIdentitySet are ordered.










instancemethods::




private:: putCheck


method:: do

You may depend on the order of items.
The function is passed two arguments, the item and an integer index.

code::
