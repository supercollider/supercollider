class:: Limiter
summary:: Peak limiter
related:: Classes/Amplitude, Classes/Compander, Classes/CompanderD, Classes/Normalizer
categories:: UGens>Dynamics


Description::

Limits the input amplitude to the given level. Limiter will not overshoot
like  link::Classes/Compander::  will, but it needs to look ahead in the
audio. Thus there is a delay equal to twice the value of the
code::dur::  parameter.

Limiter, unlike Compander, is completely transparent for an in range signal.

classmethods::

method::ar

argument::in
The signal to be processed.

argument::level
The peak output amplitude level to which to normalize the input.

argument::dur
aka lookAheadTime.
The buffer delay time. Shorter times will produce smaller delays
and quicker transient response times, but may introduce amplitude
modulation artifacts.


Examples::

code::
(
// example signal to process
Synth.play({
	var z;
	z = Decay2.ar(
		Impulse.ar(8, LFSaw.kr(0.25, -0.6, 0.7)),
		0.001, 0.3, FSinOsc.ar(500));
}, 0.8)
)

(
Synth.play({
	var z;
	z = Decay2.ar(
		Impulse.ar(8, LFSaw.kr(0.25, -0.6, 0.7)),
		0.001, 0.3, FSinOsc.ar(500));
	[z, Limiter.ar(z, 0.4, 0.01)]
}, 0.5)
)
