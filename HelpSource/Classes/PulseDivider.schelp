class:: PulseDivider
summary:: Pulse divider.
categories::  UGens>Triggers


Description::

Outputs one impulse each time it receives a certain number of triggers at
its input.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::trig

Trigger. Trigger can be any signal. A trigger happens when the
signal changes from non-positive to positive.


argument::div

Number of triggers to count before outputting an impulse.


argument::start

Starting value for the trigger count. This lets you start
somewhere in the middle of a count. If start is negative
it adds that many counts to the first time the output is
triggered.


Examples::

code::

SynthDef("help-PulseDivider",{ arg out=0;
	var p, a, b;
	p = Impulse.ar(8);
	a = SinOsc.ar(1200, 0, Decay2.ar(p, 0.005, 0.1));
	b = SinOsc.ar(600,  0, Decay2.ar(PulseDivider.ar(p, 4), 0.005, 0.5));

	Out.ar(out,(a + b) * 0.4)
}).play;
