description::
code::ExponentialGridLines:: is a strategy object that finds suitable intervals for plotting grid lines and labels. The values span the range defined by a corresponding link::Classes/ControlSpec::. Most of the functionality of code::ExponentialGridLines:: is inherited from its superclass, link::Classes/AbstractGridLines::. The instance methods are used by link::Classes/DrawGrid:: (which is in turn used by link::Classes/Plotter::) which handles the drawing of the lines and labels.

code::ExponentialGridLines:: isn't usually instantiated directly, but rather by the link::Classes/GridLines:: factory class or the link::Classes/ControlSpec#-grid:: method which returns the appropriate code::AbstractGridLines:: subclass for the given spec.

code::
(
// LinearGridLines
var linGrid = ControlSpec(0, 100, \lin, units: "Time").grid;
// ExponentialGridLines
var expGrid = \freq.asSpec.grid;

DrawGrid.test(linGrid, expGrid);
)
