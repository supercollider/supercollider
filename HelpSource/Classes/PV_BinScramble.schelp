class:: PV_BinScramble
summary:: Scramble bins.
categories:: UGens>FFT

Description::

Randomizes the order of the bins. The trigger will select a new random ordering.


classmethods::

method::new

argument::buffer

FFT buffer.


argument::wipe

Scrambles more bins as wipe moves from 0 to 1.


argument::width

A value from zero to one, indicating the maximum randomized
distance of a bin from its original location in the spectrum.


argument::trig

A trigger, that selects a new random ordering.


Examples::

code::

s.boot;
b = Buffer.read(s, Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/a11wlk01.wav");

(
// trig with MouseY
SynthDef("help-binScramble", { |out = 0, soundBufnum = 2|
	var in, chain;
	in = PlayBuf.ar(1, soundBufnum, BufRateScale.kr(soundBufnum), loop: 1);
	chain = FFT(LocalBuf(2048), in);
	chain = PV_BinScramble(chain, MouseX.kr, 0.1, MouseY.kr > 0.5);
	Out.ar(out, 0.1 * IFFT(chain).dup);
}).play(s, [\soundBufnum, b]);
)
