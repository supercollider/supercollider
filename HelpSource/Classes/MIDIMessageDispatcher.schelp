description::
MIDIMessageDispatcher is used to dispatch incoming MIDI noteOn, noteOff, control, and polytouch messages to matching functions. Normally users should not have to create or message instances of this class directly.


CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
creates a new instance.
argument::messageType
A link::Classes/Symbol:: indicating the message type, one of code::\noteOn::, code::\noteOff::, code::\control::, or code::\polytouch::.

returns:: A new MIDIMessageDispatcher.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

method::messageType
gets this dispatcher's message type, one of code::\noteOn::, code::\noteOff::, code::\control::, or code::\polytouch::.

returns:: A link::Classes/Symbol::.

method::getKeysForFuncProxy
gets the keys at which a responder func's functions are stored in this dispatcher's active dictionary. The keys will be MIDI message numbers.
argument::funcProxy
The link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: or link::Classes/MIDIdef:: whose keys should be returned.

returns:: An link::Classes/Array:: containing the funcProxy's message number as an link::Classes/Integer::.

method::value
Attempt to match an incoming MIDI message with this dispatcher's responder funcs, and evaluate their functions for all matches found.
argument::src
The UID of the source of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::.
argument::chan
The channel number of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-15.
argument::num
The message number (e.g. note number, etc.) of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-127.
argument::val
The message value (e.g. velocity, etc.) of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-127.

method::register
adds this dispatcher to the appropriate receive hook in link::Classes/MIDIIn::.

method::unregister
removes this dispatcher from the appropriate receive hook in link::Classes/MIDIIn::.

method::wrapFunc
Called internally to wrap functions in message matcher objects, if needed.
argument::funcProxy
An instance of link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: or link::Classes/MIDIdef:: whose function(s) are to be wrapped.

method::typeKey
gets a key indicating the type of message this dispatcher responds to, in the form: code::('MIDI ' ++ messageType).asSymbol::.

returns:: A link::Classes/Symbol::.
