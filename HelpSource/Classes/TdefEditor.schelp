related:: Classes/TdefGui










description::




warning::
Has been rewritten and renamed link::Classes/TdefGui::, which has largely the same functionality, but is more consistent and more flexible.
There are some changes to the *new method:

definitionlist::
## instead of || *new(px, nVars, height, width, parent, makeWatcher)
## TdefGui uses || *new (object, numItems, parent, bounds, extras)
::

strong::px:: is now strong::object::, strong::nVars:: is now strong::numItems::, strong::width & height:: can be put as strong::bounds: height @ width ::, strong::parent:: is still strong::parent::, strong::makeWatcher:: is now strong::makeSkip:: .

Please see link::Classes/TdefGui:: for more details.
