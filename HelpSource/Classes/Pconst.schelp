class:: Pconst
summary:: constrain the sum of a value pattern
related:: Classes/Pfindur, Classes/Pfin, Classes/Pfinval
categories:: Streams-Patterns-Events>Patterns>Repetition

description::

Similar to link::Classes/Pfindur::, but works with the value directly.

note::
Be careful if this is used, directly or indirectly, for a note-length parameter! The difference may be very small and this could result in zombie nodes, due to a bug in link::Classes/EnvGen:: for very short sustain times.
::

ClassMethods::

method::new
Embeds elements of the strong::pattern:: into the stream until the sum comes close enough to strong::sum::. At that point, the difference between the specified sum and the actual running sum is embedded.

Examples::

code::
(
var a, x;
a = Pconst(5, Prand([1, 2, 0.5, 0.1], inf));
x = a.asStream;
9.do({ x.next(Event.default).postln; });
)


//Pconst used as a sequence of pitches

(
SynthDef(\help_sinegrain,
	{ arg out=0, freq=440, sustain=0.05;
		var env;
		env = EnvGen.kr(Env.perc(0.01, sustain, 0.2), doneAction: Done.freeSelf);
		Out.ar(out, SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, env))
	}).add;
)

(
Pn(
	Pbind(
		\dur, Pconst(1, Prand([1, 0.02, 0.2], inf)),
		\instrument, \help_sinegrain,
		\degree, Pseries(0, 1, inf),
		\octave, 6
	)
).play;
