class:: PV_MagSquared
summary:: Square magnitudes.
related:: Classes/FFT, Classes/IFFT
categories:: UGens>FFT

Description::

Squares the magnitudes and renormalizes to previous peak. This makes weak
bins weaker.


classmethods::

method::new

argument::buffer

FFT buffer.


Examples::

code::

s.boot;

(
b = Buffer.alloc(s, 2048, 1);
c = Buffer.read(s, Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/a11wlk01.wav");
)

(
SynthDef("help-magSquared", { |out = 0, bufnum = 0, soundBufnum = 2|
	var in, chain;
	in = PlayBuf.ar(1, soundBufnum, BufRateScale.kr(soundBufnum), loop: 1);
	chain = FFT(bufnum, in);
	chain = PV_MagSquared(chain);
	Out.ar(out, 0.003 * IFFT(chain).dup);
}).play(s, [\out, 0, \bufnum, b.bufnum, \soundBufnum, c.bufnum]);
)
