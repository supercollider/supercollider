class:: PV_BrickWall
summary:: Zero bins.
related:: Classes/FFT, Classes/IFFT
categories:: UGens>FFT

Description::

Clears bins above or below a cutoff point.


classmethods::

method::new

argument::buffer

FFT buffer.


argument::wipe

Can range between -1 and +1.


If
code::wipe::  == 0 then there is no effect.


If
code::wipe::  > 0 then it acts like a high
pass filter, clearing bins from the bottom up.


If
code::wipe::  < 0 then it acts like a low
pass filter, clearing bins from the top down.


Examples::

code::

s.boot;

(
{
	var in, chain;
	in = WhiteNoise.ar(0.2);
	chain = FFT(LocalBuf(2048), in);
	chain = PV_BrickWall(chain, SinOsc.kr(0.1));
	IFFT(chain);
}.play
)
