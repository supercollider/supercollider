class:: Resonz
summary:: Resonant filter.
related:: Classes/Formlet, Classes/RHPF, Classes/RLPF, Classes/Ringz
categories::  UGens>Filters>Linear


Description::

This is the same as  link::Classes/Ringz::, except that it has a constant gain at 0 dB instead of being constant skirt.

It is a two pole resonant filter with zeroes at

code::
z = Â±1
::


Based on  emphasis::K. Steiglitz, "A Note on Constant-Gain Digital Resonators", Computer Music Journal, vol 18, no. 4, pp. 8-10, Winter 1994::.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::in

The input signal.


argument::freq

Resonant frequency in Hertz.
WARNING: due to the nature of its implementation frequency values close to 0 may cause glitches and/or extremely loud audio artifacts!

argument::bwr

Bandwidth ratio (reciprocal of Q). rq = bandwidth / centerFreq.


The reciprocal of Q is used rather than Q because it saves a
divide operation inside the unit generator.


argument::mul

Output will be multiplied by this value.


argument::add

This value will be added to the output.


Examples::

code::

{ Resonz.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), 2000, 0.1) }.play

// modulate frequency
{ Resonz.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), XLine.kr(1000, 8000, 10), 0.05) }.play

// modulate bandwidth
{ Resonz.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), 2000, XLine.kr(1, 0.001, 8)) }.play

// modulate bandwidth opposite direction
{ Resonz.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), 2000, XLine.kr(0.001, 1, 8)) }.play
