method:: availableStyles

Returns an array of all available styles on this platform. For use with link::#-style::.

method:: cursorPosition

Gets the current position of the cursor as a link::Classes/Point::.

method:: debugLevel

Gets or sets the verbosity level for debug output from "QtCollider" code. SuperCollider must have
been built in debug mode for messages to appear. Valid values are -1 (none), 0 (warnings only,
default), 1 (most messages), and 2 (verbose). Values outside this range are effectively clipped.

method:: focusView

Gets the currently focused view.

method:: palette

Gets or sets the link::Classes/QPalette:: used for GUI display.

method:: selectedText

Gets the selected text in the currently focused view. If there is no such string then return
empty string.

Internally, first calls code::selectedText:: if that method is available; otherwise, calls
code::selectedString:: if that method is available. Otherwise, returns empty string.

method:: stringBounds

Returns a link::Classes/Rect:: representing the size of the smallest rectangle that could contain a
given string rendered with the given font.

code::
QtGUI.stringBounds("hellooo", Font(Font.defaultSansFace, 100))
::

argument:: aString
A link::Classes/String:: to render.

argument:: aFont
An instance of link::Classes/Font::.

method:: style

Gets or sets the current GUI style. The given style must be a link::Classes/String:: or
link::Classes/Symbol:: that names one of the styles returned by link::#-availableStyles::.
