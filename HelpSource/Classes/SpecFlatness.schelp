description::
Given an link::Classes/FFT:: strong::chain:: this calculates the emphasis::Spectral Flatness:: measure, defined as a power spectrum's geometric mean divided by its arithmetic mean. This gives a measure which ranges from approx 0 for a pure sinusoid, to approx 1 for white noise.

The measure is calculated linearly. For some applications you may wish to convert the value to a decibel scale - an example of such conversion is shown below.

method:: kr

code::

(
{ // Example - vary mixture of white noise and pure tone with the mouse
	var in, chain, flat, flatdb, flatdbsquish;

	in = XFade2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, SinOsc.ar, MouseX.kr(-1,1));
	chain = FFT(LocalBuf(1, 2048), in);
	Out.ar(0, in * 0.1);

	flat = SpecFlatness.kr(chain);

	flatdb = 10 * flat.log; // Convert to decibels
	flatdbsquish = LinLin.kr(flatdb, -45, -1.6, 0, 1).max(-10); // Rescale db roughly to 0...1.

	flat.poll(10, "flatness: ");
	flatdb.poll(10, "flatness (db): ");

	[flat, flatdbsquish]
}.scope;

{ // Now try with your own voice
	var in, chain;
	in = SoundIn.ar([0,1]).mean;
	chain = FFT(LocalBuf(1, 2048), in);
	Out.kr(0, [in, SpecFlatness.kr(chain).poll(1, "flatness: ")]);
