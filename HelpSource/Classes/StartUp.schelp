description::

StartUp registers functions to perform an action after the library has been compiled, and after the startup file has run.
For instance this is used for creating link::Classes/SynthDef:: in the strong::initClass:: function of class files in order to be able to make the synthdef directory customizable by the startup script.

If an object is registered, strong::doOnStartUp:: must be implemented. Otherwise a function can be used.

classmethods::

method:: add

Registers an object or function to be evaluated after startup is finished.

method:: defer

Registers an object or function to be evaluated after startup is finished, or immediately, if this has happened already.

method:: remove

Removes an object that was previously registered.

method:: run

Call the object in order.

examples::

code::
*initClass {
	StartUp.add {
		// something to do...
	}
