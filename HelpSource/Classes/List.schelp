CLASS::List
summary::list of items of variable size
related::Classes/Array
categories::Collections>Ordered

DESCRIPTION::
List is a subclass of SequenceableCollection with unlimited growth in size. Although not a subclass of link::Classes/Array:: or its superclass link::Classes/ArrayedCollection:: it uses an Array in its implementation and is in many cases interchangeable with one. (List implements many of the same methods as Array.)

Arrays have a fixed maximum size. If you add beyond that size a new Array is created and returned, but you must use an assignment statement or the new array will be lost. (See the link::Classes/Array:: helpfile.) List has no size limitation and is thus more flexible, but has slightly more overhead.
code::
(
x = Array.new(3);
y = List.new(3);
5.do({ |i| z = x.add(i); y.add(i) });
x.postln; z.postln; y.postln;
)
::

Many of List's methods are inherited from link::Classes/SequenceableCollection:: or link::Classes/Collection:: and are documented in those helpfiles.

CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
Creates a List with the initial capacity given by strong::size::.

method::newClear
Creates a List with the initial capacity given by strong::size:: and slots filled with nil.

method::copyInstance
Creates a List by copying strong::aList::'s array variable.

method::newUsing
Creates a List using strong::anArray::.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

method::asArray
Returns a new link::Classes/Array:: based upon this List.

method::array
Returns the List's Array, allowing it to be manipulated directly. This should only be necessary for exotic manipulations not implemented in List or its superclasses.
code::
(
x = List[1, 2, 3];
x.array.add("foo");
x.postln;
)
::

method::array
Sets the List's Array.

method::at
Return the item at strong::index::.
code::
List[1, 2, 3].at(0).postln;
::

method::clipAt
Same as link::#-at::, but values for strong::index:: greater than the link::Classes/List:: instance size minus one will be clipped to code::size - 1::, which is the last index.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-|@|:: is its syntactic shorcut.
code::
y = List[1, 2, 3]

y.clipAt(13)
y|@|13

y.clipAt(13).postln
(y|@|13).postln
y|@|13.postln
::

method::wrapAt
link::#-wrapAt:: is the similar to link::#-at:: but with wrap-around behavior.
If the index exceeds the upper bound of the collection code::size - 1:: it wraps back around to code::0::.
Similarly if the index is negative it wraps to access the elements from the end of the collection.
Specifically link::#-wrapAt:: uses a modulo function: code::this.wrapAt(index):: is equivalent to code::this.at(index mod: size)::, insuring that the index is always in the valid range of the collection.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-@@:: is its syntactic shorcut.
code::
y = List[1, 2, 3]

y.wrapAt(3); // this returns the value at index 0
y@@3       // syntactic shorcut

y.wrapAt(4); // this returns the value at index 1
y.wrapAt([-2, 1])   // index can also be a collection or negative numbers
y@@[-2, 1] // syntactic shorcut

y.wrapAt(3).postln
(y@@3).postln
y@@3.postln
::

method::foldAt
Same as link::#-at::, but values for strong::index:: greater than the size of the link::Classes/List:: will be folded back.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-@|@:: is its syntactic shorcut.
code::
y = List[1, 2, 3]

y.foldAt(3) // this returns the value at index 1
y@|@3       // syntactic shorcut

y.foldAt(4) // this returns the value at index 0
y.foldAt(5) // this returns the value at index 1

y.foldAt(3).postln
(y@|@3).postln
y@|@3.postln
::

method::put
Put strong::item:: at strong::index::, replacing what is there.

method::clipPut
Same as link::#-put::, but values for strong::index:: greater than the link::Classes/List:: instance size minus one will be clipped to code::size - 1::, which is the last index.

method::wrapPut
Same as link::#-put::, but values for strong::index:: greater than the link::Classes/List:: instance size minus one will be wrapped around to 0.

method::foldPut
Same as link::#-put::, but values for strong::index:: greater than the link::Classes/List:: instance size minus one will be folded back.

method::add
Adds an strong::item:: to the end of the List.

method::addFirst
Inserts the strong::item:: at the beginning of the List.

method::insert
Inserts the strong::item:: into the contents of the List at the indicated strong::index::.

method::pop
Remove and return the last element of the List.

method::grow
Increase the size of the List by strong::sizeIncrease:: number of slots.

method::removeAt
Remove and return the element at strong::index::, shrinking the size of the List.
code::
y = List[1, 2, 3];
y.removeAt(1);
y.postln;
::

method::fill
Inserts the item into the contents of the receiver, possibly returning a new collection. note::the difference between this and link::Classes/Collection#*fill#Collection's *fill::.::
code::
(
var z;
z = List[1, 2, 3, 4];
z.fill(4).postln;
z.fill([1, 2, 3, 4]).postln;
)
::

code::
List['a', 'b', 'c'].do({ |item, i| [i, item].postln });
::

method::reverseDo
Iterate over the elements in reverse order, calling the function for each element. The function is passed two arguments, the element and an index.
code::

::

method::pairsDo
Calls function for each subsequent pair of elements in the List. The function is passed the two elements and an index.
