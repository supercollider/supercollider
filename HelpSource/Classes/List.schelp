summary::list of items of variable size

DESCRIPTION::
List is a subclass of SequenceableCollection with unlimited growth in size. Although not a subclass of link::Classes/Array:: or its superclass link::Classes/ArrayedCollection:: it uses an Array in its implementation and is in many cases interchangeable with one. (List implements many of the same methods as Array.)

Arrays have a fixed maximum size. If you add beyond that size a new Array is created and returned, but you must use an assignment statement or the new array will be lost. (See the link::Classes/Array:: helpfile.) List has no size limitation and is thus more flexible, but has slightly more overhead.
code::
(
x = Array.new(3);
y = List.new(3);
5.do({ |i| z = x.add(i); y.add(i) });
x.postln; z.postln; y.postln;
)
::

Many of List's methods are inherited from link::Classes/SequenceableCollection:: or link::Classes/Collection:: and are documented in those helpfiles.

CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
Creates a List with the initial capacity given by strong::size::.

method::newClear
Creates a List with the initial capacity given by strong::size:: and slots filled with nil.

method::copyInstance
Creates a List by copying strong::aList::'s array variable.

method::newUsing
Creates a List using strong::anArray::.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

method::asArray
Returns a new link::Classes/Array:: based upon this List.

method::array
Returns the List's Array, allowing it to be manipulated directly. This should only be necessary for exotic manipulations not implemented in List or its superclasses.
code::
(
x = List[1, 2, 3];
x.array.add("foo");
x.postln;
)
::

method::array
Sets the List's Array.

method::at
Return the item at strong::index::.
Accepts either a single index or an array of indices, in which case an Array of elements is returned.
link::Classes/Array:: is its syntactic shortcut.
code::
x = List[1, 2, 3] //-> [1, 2, 3]

// Retrieve the value at index 1:
x.at(1) //-> 2
// Equivalent shorthand syntax:
x[1] //-> 2

// An index can also be retrieved from an array (returns not a list, but an array):
y = [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] //-> [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]
x[y]; //-> [1, 1, 3, 3, 2]

(
var pitches =  [43.0, 55.0, 58.86, 57.42, 67.0];
fork {
	pitches.size.do{ |i|
		{
			var freq = pitches[i].midicps;
			var env = Env.perc.ar(Done.freeSelf);
			SinOsc.ar(freq) * 0.1 * env
		}.play;
		0.2.wait
	}
}
)
::

method::clipAt
Similar to link::#-at::, but guarantees that any value for index is valid by clipping values outside the collection's bounds.
Values greater than code::size - 1:: are clipped to that last index, and values below code::0:: (negative) are clipped to 0.
When passed an array of indices, returns a new Array containing the elements at the specified positions.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-|@|:: is its syntactic shortcut.
code::
a = List[1, 2, 3]
a.clipAt(2) // same as at
a.clipAt(3) // clips
a.clipAt([-1, 3, 1]) // array of indices (returns not a list, but an array)
a|@|3 //syntactic shortcut
::

method::wrapAt
Similar to link::#-at::, but guarantees that any value for index is valid by wrapping values outside the collection's bounds.
If the index exceeds code::size - 1::, it wraps back around to code::0::.
Similarly, if the index is below code::0:: (negative), it wraps to access elements from the end of the collection.
code::this.wrapAt(index):: is equivalent to code::this.at(index mod: size)::, ensuring the index is always within the valid range of the collection.
The index can also be an array of indices to extract the specified elements.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-@@:: is its syntactic shortcut.
code::
a = List[1, 2, 3]
a.wrapAt(2) // same as at
a.wrapAt(3) // wraps
a.wrapAt([-1, 3, 1]) // array of indices (returns not a list, but an array)
a@@3 //syntactic shortcut

(
var pitches =  [43.0, 55.0, 58.86, 57.42, 67.0];
fork {
	32.do{ |i|
		{
			var freq = pitches.wrapAt(i).midicps;
			var env = Env.perc.ar(Done.freeSelf);
			SinOsc.ar(freq) * 0.1 * env
		}.play;
		0.2.wait
	}
}
)
::

method::foldAt
Similar to link::#-at::, but guarantees that any value for index is valid by reflecting values outside the collection's bounds.
Values greater than code::size - 1:: are reflected back toward lower indices.
Similarly, if the index is below code::0:: (negative), it folds in the opposite direction.
This creates a symmetrical mapping of any index within the collection's boundaries.
The index can also be an array of indices to extract the specified elements.
link::Classes/SequenceableCollection#-@|@:: is its syntactic shortcut.
code::
a = List[1, 2, 3]
a.foldAt(2) // same as at
a.foldAt(3) // folds back
a.foldAt([-1, 3, 1]) // array of indices (returns not a list, but an array)
a@|@3 //syntactic shortcut

(
var pitches =  [43.0, 55.0, 58.86, 57.42, 67.0];
fork {
	32.do{ |i|
		{
			var freq = pitches.foldAt(i).midicps;
			var env = Env.perc.ar(Done.freeSelf);
			SinOsc.ar(freq) * 0.1 * env
		}.play;
		0.2.wait
	}
}
)
