description::


After it has booted, this collection of link::Classes/SynthDef::s is sent to the server. The SynthDefs are used for purposes such as routing audio and writing to busses, see link::Classes/Event:: and link::Classes/NodeProxy::. The SynthDefs are instantiated automatically at link::Classes/StartUp::. For non-realtime-synthesis, they have to be added explicitly, see link::Classes/Score#-addSystemSynthDefs::.

When playing functions anonymously (link::Classes/Function#-play::), the temporary SynthDef names are also generated by this class.


classmethods::


subsection:: System SynthDefs


method::numChannels

the SystemSynthDefs class generates SynthDefs with different number of channels that are chosen according to need. This class variable specifies the maximum number of channels.


method::synthDefs

the list of non-temporary synthDefs generated.

code::
SystemSynthDefs.synthDefs.do { |x| x.name.postln }; // post the names of SynthDefs
::


subsection:: Temporary SynthDef names


method::generateTempName

returns a new temporary name

code::
SystemSynthDefs.generateTempName
::


method::tempNamePrefix

a prefix name that can be used to distinguish Synths from other names to avoid collision.

code::
a = { SinOsc.ar * 0.01 }.play;
a.defName; // has the prefix 'temp__', followed by a number
::


method::maxTempDefNames

a maximum count for the numbers to add to the tempNamePrefix
