class:: Normalizer
summary:: Flattens dynamics.
related:: Classes/Amplitude, Classes/Compander, Classes/CompanderD, Classes/Limiter
categories:: UGens>Dynamics


Description::

Normalizes the input amplitude to the given level. Normalizer will not
overshoot like  link::Classes/Compander::  will, but it needs to look
ahead in the audio. Thus there is a delay equal to twice the value
of the  code::dur::  parameter.


classmethods::

method::ar

argument::in
The signal to be processed.

argument::level
The peak output amplitude level to which to normalize the input.

argument::dur

The buffer delay time. Shorter times will produce smaller delays
and quicker transient response times, but may introduce amplitude
modulation artifacts.


Examples::

code::

(
// example signal to process
Synth.play({
	var z;
	z = Decay2.ar(
		Impulse.ar(8, LFSaw.kr(0.25, -0.6, 0.7)),
		0.001, 0.3, FSinOsc.ar(500));
}, 0.8)
)

(
Synth.play({
	var z;
	z = Decay2.ar(
		Impulse.ar(8, LFSaw.kr(0.25, -0.6, 0.7)),
		0.001, 0.3, FSinOsc.ar(500));
	[z, Normalizer.ar(z, 0.4, 0.01)]
}, 0.5)
)
