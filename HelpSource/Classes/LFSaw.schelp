summary:: Sawtooth oscillator

categories::  UGens>Generators>Deterministic


Description::

A non-band-limited sawtooth oscillator. Output ranges from -1 to +1.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::freq
Frequency in Hertz.

argument::iphase

Initial phase offset. For efficiency reasons this is a value
ranging from 0 to 2.
Note:: enter "1" for an initial phase of 0 radians.
A value of 0 would start the cycle at pi radians. See the example below.::

argument::mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument::add
This value will be added to the output.

Examples::

code::
{ LFSaw.ar(500, 1, 0.1) }.play

// used as both Oscillator and LFO:
{ LFSaw.ar(LFSaw.kr(4, 0, 200, 400), 0, 0.1) }.play

::

Display the special behaviour of the initial phase parameter:

code::
 // three channels, three phases
{ LFSaw.ar(20, [0, 1, 2]) }.plot(0.1)
