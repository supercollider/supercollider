class:: InRect
summary:: Test if a point is within a given rectangle.
related:: Classes/InRange, Classes/Schmidt
categories::  UGens>Maths


Description::
A pair of signals x and y are treated as a point (x, y) in 2-D; if they fall within the bounds of the rectangle, then this UGen outputs a one; else it outputs zero.


classmethods::
method::ar, kr

argument::x
X component signal

argument::y
Y component signal

argument::rect
A link::Classes/Rect:: which defines the rectangular region to monitor; note that Rects are in screen co-ordinates, so the top is smaller than the bottom. The Rect is created once and cannot be modulated.

examples::
code::
// we'll hear the sawtooth wave when the two sine oscillators are both in the region x = 0.0 to 0.5, y = 0.5 to 1.0
{ InRect.ar(SinOsc.ar(1), SinOsc.ar(1.3), Rect(0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5))*LFSaw.ar(44, 0, 0.1) }.play

// stereo effect
{ (InRect.ar(LFNoise0.ar([140, 141]), LFNoise0.ar(143), Rect(0, 0, 0.5, 1)).lag(0.1))*LFSaw.ar(SinOsc.ar(10, 0, 5, 400), 0, 0.1) }.play


// for the Rect, create as left, 'top', width, height;
r = Rect(0, 0, 0, 1)

r.left
r.right
r.top
