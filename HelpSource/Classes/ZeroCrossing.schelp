class:: ZeroCrossing
summary:: Zero crossing frequency follower
categories:: UGens>Analysis>Pitch

description::
Outputs a frequency based upon the distance between interceptions of the X axis. The X intercepts are determined via linear interpolation so this gives better than just integer wavelength resolution. This is a very crude pitch follower, but can be useful in some situations.

classmethods::
method:: ar, kr
argument::in
Input signal.

examples::

code::
s.boot;
(
{
    var a;
    a = SinOsc.ar(SinOsc.kr(1, 0, 600, 700), 0, 0.1);
    [a, ZeroCrossing.ar(a) * 0.0005]
}.scope;
)
