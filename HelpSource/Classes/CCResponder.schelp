description::




note::
SC 3.5 added the link::Classes/MIDIFunc::and link::Classes/MIDIdef::classes. These are faster, and aim to have a more convenient, logical and consistent interface, which shares a common design with link::Classes/OSCFunc::and link::Classes/OSCdef::.
They also provide support for all MIDI message types.

classmethods::




method:: new


argument:: function

A link::Classes/Function:: to be evaluated. Arguments passed to the function are:
src, chan, num, value.


argument:: src

The src number may be the system UID (obtained from code:: MIDIClient.sources[index].uid ::) or the index of the source in the code:: MIDIClient.sources :: array. nil matches all.


argument:: chan

An link::Classes/Integer:: between 0 and 15 that selects which MIDI channel to match.
nil matches all. May also be a link::Classes/Function:: which will be evaluated to determine the match.
eg: { |val| val < 2 }


argument:: num

An link::Classes/Integer:: between 0 and 127 that selects which controller number to match.
nil matches all. May also be a link::Classes/Function:: which will be evaluated to determine the match.
eg: { |val| val >= 4 }


argument:: value

An link::Classes/Integer:: between 0 and 127 to filter values.
nil matches all. May also be a link::Classes/Function:: which will be evaluated to determine the match.
eg: { |val| val < 50 }


argument:: install

If teletype::true::, install the responder automatically so it is active and ready to respond.
If teletype::false::, then it will be inactive.


argument:: swallowEvent

If teletype::true::, then if the midi event is matched, cease testing any further responders.
Note that doing this will prevent any other responders of this type from responding, including ones added behind the scenes in classes.
Note also that this functionality is sensitive to the order in which responders are added.










instancemethods::




method:: learn


Wait for the next CC message, reset to match src, chan, cc num.

code::
(

c = CCResponder({ |src, chan, num, value|
		[src, chan, num, value].postln;
	});
	c.learn; // wait for the first controller
)
CCResponder.removeAll
::










examples::




code::
(
	c = CCResponder({ |src, chan, num, value|
		[src, chan, num, value].postln;
		},
		nil, // any source
		nil, // any channel
		nil, // any CC number
		nil // any value
	)
)

c.remove
::

code::
(
	c = CCResponder({ |src, chan, num, value|
		[src, chan, num, value].postln;
		},
		nil, // any source
		nil, // any channel
		80, // CC number 80
		{ |val| val < 50 } // any value less than 50
	)
)
