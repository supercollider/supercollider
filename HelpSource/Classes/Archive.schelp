CLASS::Archive
summary::storing objects to file
categories:: Collections, Files
related::Classes/Library, Classes/Object, Classes/LibraryBase

DESCRIPTION::
Archives can write any object to disk and read from file again. Compex structures of objects can thus be restored. Writing an object to file as a strong::compile string:: is usually more readable, but does not account for the internal structure of the object.

There is only one global instance: Archive.global, which is initialized automatically.

CLASSMETHODS::

private::initClass

method::global
set or get the global archive instance

method::archiveDir
set or get the directory that the archive is written to.
Default: link::Classes/Platform::.userAppSupportDir.

method::write
write the global archive now. This is called automatically when SuperCollider quits.
The default filename is "/archive.sctxar"

method::read
read the global archive now. This is called automatically when SuperCollider recompiles or starts.
The default filename is "/archive.sctxar"

EXAMPLES::

code::
// make a storage place for various objects:
q = (); // Event

q[\a_long_array] = Array.rand(128, 0.0, 1.0);
q[\pi_squared] = pi * pi;
q[\favourite_sound] = { { SinOsc.ar([300, 330]).sum * LFPulse.kr(2 + [0, 0.01]) * 0.1 }.play };
q[\same_long_array] = q[\a_long_array]; // same objects may appear several times

Archive.global.put(\myData, q);


Archive.global.at(\myData).postcs;

// after a recompile:
s.boot;

q = Archive.global.at(\myData);
q.postcs;
q[\favourite_sound].value;
