class:: PV_MagSmear
summary:: Average magnitudes across bins.
categories:: UGens>FFT

Description::

Average a bin's magnitude with its neighbors.


classmethods::

method::new

argument::buffer

FFT buffer.


argument::bins

Number of bins to average on each side of bin. As this number
rises, so will CPU usage.


Examples::

code::

s.boot;

(
b = Buffer.alloc(s, 2048, 1);
c = Buffer.read(s, Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/a11wlk01.wav");
)

(
SynthDef("help-magSmear", { |out = 0, bufnum = 0|
	var in, chain;
	in = LFSaw.ar(500, 0, Decay2.ar(Impulse.ar(2, 0, 0.2), 0.01, 2));
	chain = FFT(bufnum, in);
	chain = PV_MagSmear(chain, MouseX.kr(0, 100));
	Out.ar(out, 0.5 * IFFT(chain).dup);
}).play(s, [\out, 0, \bufnum, b.bufnum]);
)

(
SynthDef("help-magSmear2", { |out = 0, bufnum = 0, soundBufnum = 2|
	var in, chain;
	in = PlayBuf.ar(1, soundBufnum, BufRateScale.kr(soundBufnum), loop: 1);
	chain = FFT(bufnum, in);
	chain = PV_MagSmear(chain, MouseX.kr(0, 100));
	Out.ar(out, 0.5 * IFFT(chain).dup);
}).play(s, [\out, 0, \bufnum, b.bufnum, \soundBufnum, c.bufnum]);
)
