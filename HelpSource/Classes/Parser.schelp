description::
Before source code can be compiled and executed it must first be emphasis::parsed::, which is a conversion of the source code string into a emphasis::parse tree::, a data structure that describes the kinds of symbols in the program source and their relationship to one another. For a detailed discussion of the parse tree data structure that the Parser produces see link::Reference/Parse-Tree-Details::.
