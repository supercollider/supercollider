description::

AbstractResponderFunc is the abstract superclass of responder funcs, which are classes which register one or more functions to respond to a particular type of input.
It provides some common functionality such as introspection.
Its two main subclasses are link::Classes/OSCFunc::, and link::Classes/MIDIFunc::.
By default responder funcs do not persist beyond Cmd-. (see link::#-permanent:: below).

Instances will register with a dispatcher (an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractDispatcher::), which will actually dispatch incoming messages to an instance's Function(s).

classmethods::

private:: initClass

method:: allFuncProxies
Get all current instances of this classes concrete subclasses, sorted by type.

returns::
An link::Classes/IdentityDictionary::.

method:: allEnabled

As allFuncProxies above, but only return those instances currently listening for input.

returns::
An link::Classes/IdentityDictionary::.

method:: allDisabled

As allFuncProxies above, but only return those instances currently not listening for input.

returns::
An link::Classes/IdentityDictionary::.

instancemethods::

private:: cmdPeriod, prFunc

method:: func
Get or set this objects response function.

returns::
The getter returns a link::Classes/Function:: or similar object.

method:: srcID

Get this object's source.

returns::
The return type will depend on subclass.
For link::Classes/OSCFunc::this will be a link::Classes/NetAddr::, for link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: a UID. This can be nil, which indicates that the object will respond to any source.

method:: enabled

Check if this object is currently responding to incoming messages.

returns::
A link::Classes/Boolean::.

method:: dispatcher

Et this object's dispatcher. This is the object which matches incoming messages with responder funcs.
Instances can use custom dispatchers to support arbitrary matching schemes.

returns::
An instance of an appropriate subclass of link::Classes/AbstractDispatcher::. (The return type will depend on subclass.)

method:: permanent

Get or set whether this responder func is persists when the user executes Cmd-. If teletype::false:: this will be disabled and removed from the global lists.
The default is false.

argument:: bool

A link::Classes/Boolean:: indicating if this object is permanent.

returns::
The getter returns a link::Classes/Boolean::.

method:: enable

Enable this object to receive incoming messages.
This is done automatically at creation time.

method:: disable

Stop this object from receiving incoming messages.

method:: add

Add a new function to the list of functions which will be executed when this object receives an incoming message.

argument:: newFunc

A link::Classes/Function:: or similar object to be added.

method:: remove

Remove a function from the list of functions which will be executed when this object receives an incoming message.

argument:: removeFunc

The link::Classes/Function:: to be removed.

method:: gui

Open a subclass specific GUI. (Not yet implemented)

returns::
 
The GUI object.

method:: oneShot

Indicate that this object should execute only once and then free itself.

method:: fix

A synonym for link::#-permanent::

method:: free

Disable this object and remove it from the global lists.
This should be done when you are finished using this object.

method:: clear

Remove all active functions from this object's function list.

examples::

See link::Classes/OSCFunc:: and link::Classes/MIDIFunc::.
