class:: KeyState
summary:: Respond to the state of a key
related:: Classes/MouseButton, Classes/MouseX, Classes/MouseY
categories::  UGens>User interaction


Description::
Respond to the state of a key.

note::
Note that this UGen does not prevent normal typing. It therefore may be
helpful to select a GUI window rather than an SC document when using
KeyState, as the latter will be altered by any keystrokes.
::

WARNING::
This UGen will not work for Linux users using Wayland, as the Wayland protocol does not allow a global keyboard or mouse state to be captured.
The UGen will return MATH::0.0:: as constant value.
For more information see https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4544
::

WARNING::
MacOS users will need to add the SuperCollider application to the Input Monitoring group in the Privacy & Security preferences to have all keys captured.

Examples::

code::
s.boot;

// execute the code below to find out a key's keycode
// the char and keycode of any key you press will be printed in the post window
(
w = Window.new("I catch keystrokes");
w.view.keyDownAction = { |view, char, modifiers, unicode, keycode|  [char, keycode].postln };
w.front;
)

// then execute this and then press the 'j' key
(
w.front; // something safe to type on
{ SinOsc.ar(800, 0, KeyState.kr(38, 0, 0.1)) }.play;
)
