Description::

helpful to select a GUI window rather than an SC document when using
KeyState, as the latter will be altered by any keystrokes.

w = Window.new("I catch keystrokes");
w.view.keyDownAction = { |view, char, modifiers, unicode, keycode|  [char, keycode].postln };
w.front;
)

// then execute this and then press the 'j' key
