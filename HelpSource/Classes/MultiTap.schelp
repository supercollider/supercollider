Description::

This is a wrapper which creates a multiple tap delay line using
link::Classes/RecordBuf::  and  link::Classes/PlayBuf:: .

note:: code::RecordBuf.ar:: and code::PlayBuf.ar:: operate block by block. If a delay time is greater than the buffer
size minus the server's block size, the write and read heads might interfere in unintended ways. Use a slightly larger
buffer if this happens. ::

classmethods::

method::ar

argument::timesArray
A Ref to an Array of delay times in seconds.

argument::levelsArray
A Ref to an Array of amplitudes.

argument::in
The input signal.

argument::mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument::add
This value will be added to the output.

argument::bufnum

The number of the buffer to use for the delay. This must be at
least as long as the longest tap time.


Examples::

code::

s.boot;
b = Buffer.alloc(s, s.sampleRate);
(
{
	MultiTap.ar(`[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], `[0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8],
		Decay.ar(Dust.ar(2), 0.1, PinkNoise.ar), bufnum: b.bufnum)
}.play
)
