class:: DragSource
summary:: A simple drag-and-drop source.
categories:: GUI>Views
related:: Classes/DragSink, Classes/DragBoth

DESCRIPTION::

link::Classes/DragSource::, link::Classes/DragSink:: and link::Classes/DragBoth:: are a set of view classes intended as simple-to-use drag-and-drop sources and destinations. They are graphically represented as a simple rectangle, and their specialty is that they emphasis::do not require the Cmd/Ctrl key to be held down to initiate dragging::.

Akin to link::Classes/StaticText:: they can store arbitrary content in the link::Classes/StaticText#-object#-object:: variable, and display it using link::Classes/Object#-asString::. You can set the displayed text separately using link::Classes/StaticText#-string#-string::, and keep it independent of the content if you set link::Classes/StaticText#-setBoth#-setBoth:: to code::false::.

strong::DragSource::, specifically, gives the strong::-object:: variable as the data strong::for dragging::, but strong::accepts no drop::.

See: link::Classes/View#Drag and drop:: for a general description of the drag and drop mechanism.

EXAMPLES::
code::
(
s.waitForBoot({	// only needed if you are using sound
	w = Window.new.front;

	// store various kinds of objects in the drag source

	// a string source
	a = DragSource(w, Rect(10, 10, 150, 20)).align_(\center);
	a.object = "I am a string source";

	// a Float source
	b = DragSource(w, Rect(10, 40, 150, 20)).align_(\center);
	b.object = 2.234;

	// a Point source
	c = DragSource(w, Rect(10, 70, 150, 20)).align_(\center);
	c.object = Point(20, 30);

	// A sound function source
	// dragLabel_() is used for the label while dragging
	d = DragSource(w, Rect(10, 100, 150, 20)).align_(\center);
	d.object = { Synth(\default) };
	d.dragLabel = " I am a sound function.\n My dragLabel_() is set \n to inform you about that ";

	// A sound function source
	// here the string label is independent of the content type (Function)
	// dragLabel_() is used for the label while dragging
	f = DragSource(w, Rect(10, 130, 150, 20)).align_(\center).setBoth_(false);
	f.object = { { SinOsc.ar(440,0,0.4) }.play };
	f.string = "My label is independent";
	f.dragLabel = " My dragLabel_() says \n I am dragging a sound function ";

	// receive anthing
	g = DragSink(w, Rect(170, 10, 200, 20)).align_(\center);
	g.string = "recieve anything, do nothing";

	// receive only floats
	g = DragSink(w, Rect(170, 40, 200, 20)).align_(\center);
	g.string = "I only like floats";
	g.canReceiveDragHandler = { View.currentDrag.isFloat };

	// receive only numbers and points, and convert them to rects
	h = DragSink(w, Rect(170, 70, 200, 20)).align_(\center);
	h.string = "I convert to Rect";
	h.canReceiveDragHandler = { View.currentDrag.isKindOf(Number) || View.currentDrag.isKindOf(Point) };
	h.receiveDragHandler = { arg v; h.object = View.currentDrag.asRect };

	// receive only functions, and try to play them
	i = DragSink(w, Rect(170, 100, 200, 20)).align_(\center);
	i.string = "I evaluate a (sound) function";
	i.canReceiveDragHandler = { View.currentDrag.isKindOf(Function) };

		i.string = "I evaluate a (sound) function";
		i.background_(Color.clear) });

	StaticText(w, Rect(10, 200, 380, 50))

		.string_("Try dragging any item on the left -----> to any item on the right");
