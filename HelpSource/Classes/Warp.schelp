description::

The subclasses of Warp specify translations from input (a number) to an output (another number).
This is an abstract class - already available shapes are emphasis::linear, exponential, sine, cosine, decibel, curve:: (this is similar to the curves in envelopes, see also link::Classes/Env::).

Warps are internally created by link::Classes/ControlSpec::.
Usually they are created by the message strong::asWarp::, understood by symbols and numbers.
A warp has a link::Classes/Spec:: to specify a certain range of input and output values.

code::
// create a new warp:
a = \exp.asWarp;
a = -4.asWarp; // a curve warp;
::

classmethods::

private:: initClass

instancemethods::

method:: map

Maps and constrains a strong::value:: between 0 and teletype::1:: to the output domain.

method:: unmap

In the output domain to a value in the range between 0 and 1.

code::
g = -3.asWarp;
g.map(0.5);
g.unmap(0.9);

// fore and back translation should be identical:
g.unmap(g.map(0.5));
