CLASS:: SendPeakRMS
summary:: Track peak and power of a signal for GUI applications.
related:: Classes/Peak, Classes/PeakFollower, Classes/OSCFunc
categories::  UGens>Analysis>Amplitude


DESCRIPTION::

The SendPeakRMS unit generator computes peak and power of a signal and sends the
computed values back to the clients. It does not produce any output.


CLASSMETHODS::

private:: new1


method::ar, kr

Unlike with other unit generators, the code::ar:: and code::kr:: methods do not
specify the rate of the computation, but the granularity. When the SendPeakRMS ugen
is instantiated with code::kr::, the reply rate is quantized to control-rate
blocks.

argument::sig

The input signal.

argument::replyRate

Float or Integer. Specifies the number of replies that are sent to the clients
per second.

argument::peakLag

Float or Integer. Lag time, which is applied to the peak values. This option is
commonly used for GUI VU meters.

argument::cmdName

Symbol or String. Address pattern for reply message.

argument::replyID

Integer ID (similar to link::Classes/SendTrig::).

INSTANCEMETHODS::
private:: numOutputs, writeOutputSpecs


EXAMPLES::

code::
(
{
	SendPeakRMS.kr(Dust.ar(20), 20, 3, "/replyAddress")
}.play;
)

(
o = OSCFunc({ |msg|
	"peak: %, rms: %".format(msg[3], msg[4]).postln
}, '/replyAddress');
)
o.free;
