DESCRIPTION::
MIDIMessageDispatcherNV is used to dispatch incoming MIDI touch, program, and bend messages to matching functions. Normally users should not have to create or message instances of this class directly.


CLASSMETHODS::


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: getKeysForFuncProxy
Get the keys at which a responder func's functions are stored in this dispatcher's active dictionary. The keys will be MIDI channels.

argument:: funcProxy
The link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: or link::Classes/MIDIdef:: whose keys should be returned.

returns:: An link::Classes/Array:: containing the funcProxy's channel number as an link::Classes/Integer::.

METHOD:: value
Attempt to match an incoming MIDI message with this dispatcher's responder funcs, and evaluate their functions for all matches found.

argument:: src
The UID of the source of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::.

argument:: chan
The channel number of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-15.

argument:: val
The message value (e.g. velocity, etc.) of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-127.

METHOD:: wrapFunc
Called internally to wrap functions in message matcher objects, if needed.

argument:: funcProxy
An instance of link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: or link::Classes/MIDIdef:: whose function(s) are to be wrapped.
