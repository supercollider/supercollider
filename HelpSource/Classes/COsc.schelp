categories::  UGens>Generators>Deterministic


Description::

Chorusing wavetable lookup oscillator. Produces sum of two signals at

code::
(freq Â± (beats / 2)).
::

Due to summing, the peak amplitude is not the same as the wavetable and can be twice of that.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::bufnum

The number of a buffer filled in wavetable format.


argument::freq

Frequency in Hertz.


argument::beats

Beat frequency in Hertz.


argument::mul

Output will be multiplied by this value.


argument::add

This value will be added to the output.


Examples::

code::

(
b = Buffer.alloc(s, 512, 1, {arg buf; buf.sine1Msg(1.0/[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])});
{ COsc.ar(b.bufnum, 200, 0.7, 0.25) }.play;
)
