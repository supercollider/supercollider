DESCRIPTION::
Provides a shortcut to the paths of example files which are bundled with SuperCollider and are located in LINK::Classes/Platform#*resourceDir::.

CODE::
// instead of writing
Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds" +/+ "a11wlk01-44_1.aiff";
// one can write
ExampleFiles.apollo11;
::

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: apollo11 
A radio recording from the Apollo 11 moon landing program where Bruce McCandless says EMPHASIS::"Columbia, this is Houston. Over."::.
For more information see LINK::https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/a11/a11.mobility.html:: at the mark TELETYPE::110:25:41:: (it seems to be the third repetition, though the pitch does not match).

TABLE::
## Filename || TELETYPE::a11wlk01-44_1.aiff::
## Channels || 1
## Samplerate || 44100 Hz
## Format || pcm_s16be
## Duration || 00:00:02.44
::

RETURNS:: The full path of TELETYPE::a11wlk01-44_1.aiff:: as a LINK::Classes/String::

DISCUSSION::
Trivia time: Although the file in its current form was introduced on 2004-07-11 by Scott Wilson via commit TELETYPE::bc9a4d4fd8cdccd2b1c787010c776176c7993d2c::, its original version as a 11025 Hz mono file dates back to at least 2002-09-28 via the commit TELETYPE::f30d769ab6b8eb1f36027ed3a400efd3b829f43a:: by James McCartney.

This can be considered the "Hello world" audio sample of SuperCollider.

METHOD:: sinedPink
A very short stereo sample which has 10 cycles of a 440Hz LINK::Classes/SinOsc:: on its first channel and a LINK::Classes/PinkNoise:: on its second channel. 

TABLE::
## Filename || TELETYPE::SinedPink.aiff::
## Channels || 2
## Samplerate || 44100 Hz
## Format || pcm_f32be
## Duration || 00:00:00.02

returns:: The full path of TELETYPE::SinedPink.aiff:: as a LINK::Classes/String:: 

METHOD:: child
Allegedly a re-recording of Link::Classes/ExampleFiles#*apollo11:: performed by a child of a developer.
