class:: BufSamples
summary:: Current number of samples in buffer.
related:: Classes/BufChannels, Classes/BufDur, Classes/BufFrames, Classes/BufRateScale, Classes/BufSampleRate
categories::  UGens>Buffer>Info

Description::

Returns the current number of allocated samples. A sample is not the same as a frame (compare with link::Classes/BufFrames::); a frame includes the samples in each channel of the buffer. Only for a mono buffer are samples the same as frames.
code::
samples = frames * numChannels
::


classmethods::

method::kr, ir

argument::bufnum
Buffer index.

discussion::
warning::
The  code::.ir::  method is not the safest choice.
Since a buffer can be reallocated at any time, using
code::.ir::  will not track the changes.
::

examples::
code::
// example; this buffer is mono, so the number of samples matches the number of frames
b = Buffer.read(s, Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/a11wlk01.wav");

// indexing with a phasor
{ BufRd.ar(1, b, Phasor.ar(0, BufRateScale.kr(b), 0, BufSamples.kr(b))) }.play;

// indexing by hand
{ BufRd.ar(1, b, K2A.ar(MouseX.kr(0, BufSamples.kr(b)))) }.play;

b.free;
