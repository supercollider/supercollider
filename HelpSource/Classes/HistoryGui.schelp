description::


HistoryGui allows easy access to History as it happens: one can read recent lines, when they were written and by whom; one can search for text strings and by author names; and one can quickly grab lines of code for rewriting. Apart from documenting just in time programming sessions, all of this can be useful in live coding performances. See e.g. the system developed by powerbooks_unplugged, in the Quark called Republic.

The gui elements in detail:

definitionlist::
## button start/end || starts and ends History emphasis::if:: code::gui.history:: is current.

## button all/filt || turns filtering on/off.
## popup all/... || selects which name key to search for (useful if networked)
## TextView || allows for typing in a search string.
## button top/keep || sets mode whether ListView stays on top line, or keeps sticking to the selected line.

## ListView || shows either all code::lineShorts::, or the filtered code::lineShorts::; selecting them in ListView makes them come appear in post-doc window.
::

first example:

code::
(
// create a short history
h = History([
	[0, \me, "1+2"],
	[1, \me, "3+5"], [1.234, \you, "q = q ? ();"],
	[3, \they, "\"The story\".speak"]
]);
// make a gui for it
g = h.makeWin(0@20);
// find or make a text window for code line display
// (called 'doc' because that was a Document in pre-Qt times)
g.findDoc;
// post line at index 2 in h.lines in doc window
g.postDoc(2);
)

classmethods::


method::docHeight

gets and sets the height of the text window opened by HistoryGui


method::docTitle

gets and sets the title of the text window opened by HistoryGui


method::new

creates a new HistoryGui

argument::object
the history

argument::numItems
the number of lines in the TextView above

argument::parent
a parent window or view in which to place new HistoryGui

argument::bounds
bounds for new HistoryGui, constrained by its minSize.

argument::makeSkip
flag whether to create a skipjack for the HistoryGui.

argument::options
options to set for the HistoryGui (inherited from JITGui).


instancemethods::


private:: accepts, checkUpdate, getState, makeViews, setDefaults, postInlined
private:: updateBinVal, updateFunc, updateLines, updateVal, alignDoc


subsection:: views


method::textV

top: the TextView for the selected line


method::startBut, filtBut, keyPop, filTextV, topBut

the line of buttons, popup and TextView


method::listV

the ListView for the history lines


method::resetViews

resets all views


method::showLineAt

show the line at that index in History.lines in the TextView.


subsection:: 'doc'-related


method::doc

the external text window made by HistoryGui to show codelines on.
This is still called doc because it used to be a Document in pre-Qt times.


method::findDoc

finds an open a re-usable text window, or make a new one


method::docFlag

gets/sets the symbol for the doc strategy to use:
code::\sameDoc:: tries to re-use a single text window,
code::\newDoc:: always makes a new one (and keep track of old docs)


method::oldDocs

list of previous text windows (docs) opened


method::postDoc

finds the codeline at index in History, and post it on the textwindow


method::setDocStr

sets the string of the current textwindow


method::rip

creates a new textwindow with currently selected line


subsection:: filtering


method::filtering

flag whether filtering is on


method::filterOn, filterOff

convenience on/off methods


method::filters

keys and string fragments to filter for.
e.g. ['all', "+"] gets lines from all sources that contain the string "+".


method::filterLines

applies filtering to history lines


method::filteredIndices

the indices of the current filtered lines


method::filteredShorts

the current filtered short lines for gui display


method::setKeyFilter

sets the key(s) to filter for, and perform filtering


method::setStrFilter

sets the string to filter for, and perform filtering


method::stickMode

stickMode 0 means top, i.e. select top when new lines come in;
stickMode 1 means keep, i.e. keep current line selected after new lines come in.


examples::

code::
(
// create a short history
h = History([
	[0, \me, "1+2"],
	[1, \me, "3+5"], [1.234, \you, "q = q ? ();"],
	[3, \they, "\"The story\".speak"]
]);
// make a gui for it
g = h.makeWin(0@20);
// find or make a text window for code line display
// (called 'doc' because that was a Document in pre-Qt times)
g.findDoc;
// post line at index 2 in h.lines in doc window
g.postDoc(2);
)

h.document;

// show how filtering works:

g.filtering; // is filter on?
g.filterOff; // shorthand for off
g.filterOn;  // and on

// filtering looks for lines by author key(s)
// and strings in the code lines:
g.filters.postcs;

g.setKeyFilter(\all);
g.setKeyFilter(\me);
g.setStrFilter("");
g.setStrFilter("3");

g.filters.postcs;

// internal state cached in the HistoryGui:
g.filteredIndices;
g.filteredShorts;
