class:: ChaosGen
summary:: UGens that cause chaos
categories:: UGens>Generators>Chaotic

description::
"ChaosGen" is an emphasis::abstract class:: - in other words, a class that you do not use directly. Instead, use one of its subclasses.
Various things inherit from this abstract class, including link::Classes/HenonN::, link::Classes/LinCongL::, link::Classes/LatoocarfianL::, link::Classes/GbmanL::, link::Classes/CuspL::, link::Classes/StandardL::, and more.

These chaotic UGens generally each represent a deterministic set of equations, which can take different starting parameters. The equations define a system whose evolution over time is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and can exhibit highly intricate behaviour.
