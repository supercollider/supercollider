categories::  UGens>Generators>Stochastic


Description::

Like link::Classes/LFClipNoise::, it generates the values -1 or +1 at a rate given
by the  code::freq::  argument, with two differences:
list::
## no time quantization
## fast recovery from low freq values footnote::
link::Classes/LFClipNoise:: , as well as  link::Classes/LFNoise0:: ,
link::Classes/LFNoise1::  and  link::Classes/LFNoise2::  quantize to the
nearest integer division of the samplerate, and they poll the
code::freq::  argument only when scheduled; thus they often
seem to hang when freqs get very low.
::
::

If you don't need very high or very low freqs, or use fixed freqs,
link::Classes/LFDClipNoise::  is more efficient.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::freq
Approximate rate at which to generate random values.

argument::mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument::add
This value will be added to the output.

Examples::

code::
// try wiggling the mouse quickly;
// LFNoise frequently seems stuck, LFDNoise changes smoothly.

{ LFClipNoise.ar(MouseX.kr(0.1, 1000, 1), 0.1)  }.play

{ LFDClipNoise.ar(MouseX.kr(0.1, 1000, 1), 0.1)  }.play

// silent for 2 secs before going up in freq

{ LFClipNoise.ar(XLine.kr(0.5, 10000, 3), 0.1) }.scope;

{ LFDClipNoise.ar(XLine.kr(0.5, 10000, 3), 0.1) }.scope;


// LFNoise quantizes time steps at high freqs, LFDNoise does not:

{ LFClipNoise.ar(XLine.kr(1000, 20000, 10), 0.1) }.scope;

{ LFDClipNoise.ar(XLine.kr(1000, 20000, 10), 0.1) }.scope;
