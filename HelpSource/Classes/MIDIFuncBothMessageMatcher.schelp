description::


This is used by link::Classes/MIDIMessageDispatcher:: to match incoming MIDI messages to instances of link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: or link::Classes/MIDIdef:: using message source and MIDI channel. This class is private, and generally users should not need to address instances directly.


classmethods::


method::new

makes a new instance.

argument::chan
(describe argument here)

argument::srcID
the UID of the MIDI source source to test against as an link::Classes/Integer::.

argument::func
the link::Classes/Function:: to evaluate if a match is found.

returns::

an MIDIFuncBothMessageMatcher.


instancemethods::


private:: init


method::value

checks to see if a message matches, and evaluate func if it does.

argument::value
the message value (e.g. velocity, etc.) of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-127.

argument::num
the message number (e.g. note number, etc.) of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-127.

argument::testChan
the channel number of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::. Note this should be in the range 0-15.

argument::testSrc
the UID of the source of the MIDI message as an link::Classes/Integer::.
