Description::
Returns the buffer's current sample rate.

classmethods::

method::kr, ir

argument::bufnum
Buffer index.

returns::
the buffer's current sample rate.

discussion::
warning::
The  code::.ir::  method is not the safest choice.
Since a buffer can be reallocated at any time, using
code::.ir::  will not track the changes.

Examples::

code::
b = Buffer.read(s, Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/a11wlk01.wav");

// compares a 1102.5 Hz sine tone (11025 * 0.1, left) with a 1100 Hz tone (right)
// the apollo sample has a sample rate of 11.025 kHz
(
{
	var freq;
	freq = [BufSampleRate.kr(b) * 0.1, 1100];
	SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, 0.1)
}.play;
)

b.free;
