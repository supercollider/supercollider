class:: BinaryOpFunction
summary:: represent a binary operation on a function
categories:: Core
related:: Classes/UnaryOpFunction, Classes/NAryOpFunction, Classes/BinaryOpStream, Classes/Pbinop, Overviews/Operators

description::
Operating on functions instead of numbers, what results is not a result of the calculation, but a structure that represents that calculation.

instanceMethods::

private::storeOn

method::value
Executes each of the operand functions and then performs the selector on the result.

method::valueArray
the same as link::#-value::

examples::

code::
// example
a = 5 + 7; // result is 12.
a = { b } + 7; // result is  a BinaryOpFunction
b = 5;
a.value; // now it is evaluated, and the result is calculated
b = 8;
a.value; // again, with a different value.
::

code::
// sound example
(
var a = { 19.rand };
var b = { [5, 8, 9].choose };
var c = a + b;
fork {
	15.do {
		(instrument: \default, note: [c.value, a.value]).play;
		0.3.wait;
	}
}
