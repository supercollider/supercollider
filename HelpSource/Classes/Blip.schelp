class:: Blip
summary:: Band limited impulse oscillator.
related:: Classes/Impulse
categories::  UGens>Generators>Deterministic


Description::

Band Limited ImPulse generator. All harmonics have equal amplitude.
This is the equivalent of 'buzz' in  emphasis::MusicN:: languages.

emphasis::Synth-O-Matic:: (1990) had an impulse generator
called blip, hence that name here rather than 'buzz'.

It is improved from other implementations in that it will crossfade
in a control period when the number of  harmonics changes,
so that there are no audible pops. It also eliminates the divide in
the formula by using a 1/sin table (with special precautions taken for
1/0).  The lookup tables are linearly interpolated for better quality.

warning::
This waveform in its raw form could be damaging to your ears at high
amplitudes or for long periods.

classmethods::

method::ar

argument::freq
Frequency in Hertz.

argument::numharm
Number of harmonics. This may be lowered internally if it would cause aliasing.

argument::mul

argument::add

Examples::

code::
// modulate frequency
{ Blip.ar(XLine.kr(20000, 200, 6), 100, 0.2) }.play;

// modulate numharmonics
{ Blip.ar(200, Line.kr(1, 100, 20), 0.2) }.play;
