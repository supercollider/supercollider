ClassMethods::
method:: allClasses
returns:: an link::Classes/Array:: of all Classes


method:: initClass

When SuperCollider starts up, just after it has compiled the library, it initializes all the classes from Object down, a depth first traversal of subclasses.

This method can be overloaded in any class that requires initialization of classvars or other resources.

note::
Each class will be initialized once, thus each class' code::initClass:: is called exactly once during the initialization phase.
::

method:: initClassTree

used in link::#*initClass:: to assure the initialisation of code::aClass:: before using it. Wherever necessary, it recursively initializes all classes required by code::aClass::.

In some cases it is required that another class and its resources are initialized before you initialize your own. This can be accomplished by


code::
YourClass {
    *initClass {
		// initialize OtherClass before continuing
        Class.initClassTree(OtherClass);

        ..

        // use OtherClass

        ..
    }

    ..

}
::

Pre-initialized data such as link::Classes/SynthDef::s should be deferred to link::Classes/StartUp::

code::
YourClass {
    *initClass {
        StartUp.add {
            ..
        }
    }

    ..

}
::

InstanceMethods::

method::browse

Open a graphical browser for this Class. Shows methods, arguments, variables, subclasses, and has buttons for navigating to the superclass, source, helpfile, etc.

method::findMethod

Find the Method referred to by name. If not found, return nil.

method::findRespondingMethodFor

As above, but climb the class tree to see if the method is inherited from a superclass. If not found, return nil.

method::respondingMethods

Return a list of methods for the selectors that an object of this class responds to.

method::instancesRespondTo

Return true if the message selector or array of message selectors are understood by objects of this class.

code::
Collection.instancesRespondTo(\flop); // false
Set.instancesRespondTo(\clear); // true
Set.instancesRespondTo([\flop, \clear]) // false: not both
::

method::findRespondingSubclasses

Return a list of all subclasses whose instances respond to the message selector or all message selector in an array.

code::
Collection.findRespondingSubclasses(\flop); // a long list
Set.findRespondingSubclasses(\clear);
Set.findRespondingSubclasses([\flop, \clear]); // not both
::

method::findRespondingUpperSubclasses

Return a list of all classes down the class tree starting from the receiver, whose instances respond to the message selector or all message selector in an array.

code::
Collection.findRespondingUpperSubclasses(\flop);
Set.findRespondingUpperSubclasses(\clear);
Set.findRespondingUpperSubclasses([\flop, \clear]); // not both
::

method::findSimilarSelectors

Returns a list of selectors similar to the argument passed. For other arguments and sorting, see link::Classes/String#-findSimilarIn::.

code::
Array.findSimilarSelectors(\skramle);
Array.findSimilarSelectors(\flip);
Array.findSimilarSelectors(\flip, maxEditDistance: 7);
::

method::dumpAllMethods

Post all instance methods which instances of this class responds too, including inherited ones. code::this.class.dumpAllMethods:: will post all class methods which this class responds to.

method::dumpByteCodes

Dump the byte codes of the named method.

method::dumpClassSubtree

Post the tree of all Classes that inherit from this class.

method::dumpInterface

Post all the methods defined by this Class and their arguments.

method::dumpFullInterface

Post all the class and instance methods that this class responds to (i.e. those defined in this class and those inherited by it).


method::help

Opens the help file for this Class if it exists.

method::helpFilePath

Returns the path of this Class's helpfile as a String.

method::helpFileForMethod

Opens the helpfile for the class in which the responding method is implemented.

code::
Array.helpFileForMethod('select'); // This will open the Collection helpfile
::

method::asClass

Return this.

method::asString

Return the name of the class as a String.
