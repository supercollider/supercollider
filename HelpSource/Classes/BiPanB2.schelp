categories::  UGens>Multichannel>Ambisonics


Description::

Encode a two channel signal to two dimensional ambisonic B-format. This
puts two channels at opposite poles of a 2D ambisonic field. This is one
way to map a stereo sound onto a soundfield. It is equivalent to:

code::
PanB2(inA, azimuth, gain) + PanB2(inB, azimuth + 1, gain)
::

classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::inA
Input signal A

argument::inB
Input signal B.

argument::azimuth
Position around the circle from -1 to +1.

-1 is behind, -0.5 is left, 0 is forward, +0.5 is right, +1 is behind.

argument::gain
Amplitude control.


Examples::

code::

(
{
	var w, x, y, p, q, a, b, c, d;

	p = LFSaw.ar(200);
	q = LFSaw.ar(301);

	// B-format encode
	#w, x, y = BiPanB2.ar(p, q, MouseX.kr(-1, 1), 0.1);

	// B-format decode to quad
	#a, b, c, d = DecodeB2.ar(4, w, x, y);

	[a, b, d, c] // reorder to my speaker arrangement: Lf Rf Lr Rr
}.play;
)
