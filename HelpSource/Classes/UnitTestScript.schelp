DESCRIPTION::
In order to make sure a method works correctly, a test can be implemented that assures the correct behavior.

It is a common practice to write tests to clarify how an object should respond, and it may avoid inconsistencies on the long run.

Test scripts are simply plain text files ending with TELETYPE::_unittest.scd::, which are interpreted.
Scripts may be located next to a class in the classpath or one folder below.
If they return a function, the code::UnitTestScript:: is passed in, allowing to call methods like assert etc. (see link::Classes/UnitTest::)

code::UnitTestScript:: mimics some of the behavior of link::Classes/Method::, to be compatible with link::Classes/UnitTest::.






CLASSMETHODS::
PRIVATE:: initClass, findTestScripts, new, findTestMethods, allScripts, runTest

INSTANCEMETHODS::

PRIVATE:: name, path, init, runScript

EXAMPLES::

An example script

NOTE::
This should be in a file TELETYPE::myUnitTest_unittest.scd::
::

code::
{ |test|
	"Kant test".postln;
	"5 + 7 = ".post;
	(5 + 7).postln;
	test.assertEquals(5 + 7, 12, "five plus seven should always be twelve");
}
::

To run only the test scripts:

code::
UnitTestScript.run;
::

The scripts are to be found under the class UnitTestScript in the GUI:

code::
UnitTest.gui
