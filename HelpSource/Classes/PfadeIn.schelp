DESCRIPTION::
Fade an event pattern in by scaling its amplitude over a period of time.

NOTE::This only works on event patterns that are playing synths that have a
code::\amp:: argument in them.::

CLASSMETHODS::
METHOD::new
ARGUMENT::pattern
The pattern to fade in. Must be an event pattern that plays a synth with the code::\amp:: parameter.
ARGUMENT::fadeTime
The time it will take to fade.
ARGUMENT::holdTime

ARGUMENT::tolerance
The tolerance for the rounding of elapsed time used when setting the amplitude
of the input pattern.

INSTANCEMETHODS::
METHOD::fadeTime
Get or set the fadetime

METHOD::holdTime
Get or set the hold time

METHOD::tolerance
Get or set the tolerance used when rounding the internal time.

METHOD::embedInStream
ARGUMENT::inval

METHOD::storeArgs

EXAMPLES::

CODE::
(
// Create a pattern that you want to fade
var pat = Pbind(\dur, 0.125, \degree, Pwhite(1, 10));

// Fade it in over 30 beats
pat = PfadeIn.new(pattern: pat, fadeTime: 30.0, holdTime: 1.0, tolerance: 0.0001);

// Play it
pat.play;
)
