CLASS:: AbstractMessageMatcher
summary:: Matches incoming messages to Functions
categories:: External Control>Abstract Classes
related:: Classes/AbstractResponderFunc, Classes/AbstractWrappingDispatcher

DESCRIPTION::
Instances of subclasses of AbstractMessageMatcher are used internally by subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractWrappingDispatcher:: to match multiple parameters of incoming messages (i.e. OSC or MIDI) to instances of subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc::. This class and its subclasses are private and generally users should not need to address them directly. Note that these objects are effectively immutable, and link::#-copy:: returns the receiver


CLASSMETHODS::


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: func
Get or set this object's response link::Classes/Function::.

returns:: A link::Classes/Function:: or similar object.

METHOD:: value
Evaluate an incoming message to see if it matches. Subclasses should override this message to take appropriate arguments. If a match is found, this method should call value on this object's func, passing the message as appropriate arguments.

METHOD:: valueArray
As link::#-value:: above, but with the arguments passed as a single link::Classes/Array::. This method is needed so that subclasses can work in FunctionLists.

argument:: args
An link::Classes/Array:: containing the message and appropriate arguments.

METHOD:: copy
Returns the receiver.
