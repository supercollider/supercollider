related:: Classes/AbstractResponderFunc, Classes/AbstractWrappingDispatcher










description::




Instances of subclasses of AbstractMessageMatcher are used by subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractWrappingDispatcher:: to match multiple parameters of incoming messages (i.e. OSC or MIDI) to instances of subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc::.
This class and its subclasses are private and generally users should not need to address them directly.










classmethods::




instancemethods::




method:: func


Get or set this object's response link::Classes/Function::.


returns::
A link::Classes/Function:: or similar object.




method:: value


Evaluate an incoming message to see if it matches.
Subclasses should override this message to take appropriate arguments.
If a match is found, this method should call value on this object's func, passing the message as appropriate arguments.




method:: valueArray


A link::#-value:: above, but with the arguments passed as a single link::Classes/Array::.
This method is needed so that subclasses can work in FunctionLists.


argument:: args

An link::Classes/Array:: containing the message and appropriate arguments.
