summary:: One zero filter.
related:: Classes/OnePole
categories::  UGens>Filters>Linear


Description::

A one zero filter. Implements the formula:

code::

out(i) = ((1 - abs(coef)) * in(i)) + (coef * in(i-1)).

::


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::in

The input signal.


argument::coef

Feed forward coefficient.


+0.5 makes a two point averaging filter
(see also
link::Classes/LPZ1::).


-0.5 makes a differentiator
(see also
link::Classes/HPZ1::).


+1 makes a single sample delay
(see also
link::Classes/Delay1::).


-1 makes an inverted single sample delay.


argument::mul

Output will be multiplied by this value.


argument::add

This value will be added to the output.


Examples::

code::

{ OneZero.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), 0.5) }.play

{ OneZero.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), -0.5) }.play

{ OneZero.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.5), Line.kr(-0.5, 0.5, 10)) }.play
