class:: Magnitude
summary:: Comparable value in a linear continuum
categories:: Math

description::
Magnitudes represent values along a linear continuum which can be compared against each other.

instancemethods::
method:: <
returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean:: whether the receiver is less than strong::aMagnitude::.

method:: <=
returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean:: whether the receiver is less than or equal to strong::aMagnitude::.

method:: >
returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean:: whether the receiver is greater than strong::aMagnitude::.

method:: >=
returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean:: whether the receiver is greater than or equal to strong::aMagnitude::.

method:: min
returns:: the minimum of the receiver and aMagnitude.

method:: max
returns:: the maximum of the receiver and aMagnitude.

method:: clip
If the receiver is less than minVal then answer minVal, else if the receiver is greater than maxVal then answer maxVal, else answer the receiver.

method:: inclusivelyBetween
returns:: whether the receiver is greater than or equal to minVal and less than or equal to maxVal.

method:: exclusivelyBetween
returns:: whether the receiver is greater than minVal and less than maxVal.
