description::


AbstractWrappingDispatcher extends AbstractDispatcher to provide the facility to wrap response functions in specialised objects (instances of subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractMessageMatcher:: to efficiently support matching of multiple parameters. Its subclasses link::Classes/OSCMessageDispatcher:: and link::Classes/MIDIMessageDispatcher:: match using a flat dictionary lookup of the 'most significant' parameter, and only attempt to match other parameters if an initial match is found. This approach is faster than others (such as multi-level dictionaries) for most configurations.


classmethods::


instancemethods::


private:: init


method::wrappedFuncs

gets a dictionary of all currently wrapped functions, stored using their owning responder funcs as keys.

returns::

an link::Classes/IdentityDictionary::.


method::add

adds a responder func to this dispatcher. Subclasses should extend this to do any necessary bookkeeping. Generally this method should add this dispatcher as a dependant of the responder func, so that it can respond to any changes.

argument::funcProxy
an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc:: to add.


method::remove

removes a responder func from this dispatcher.

argument::funcProxy
an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc:: to remove.


method::updateFuncForFuncProxy

this method is called within link::#-update:: to update any changes to one of this dispatcher's responder funcs' function(s). Users should not call this method directly, but subclasses may need to extend this method to do additional bookkeeping.

argument::funcProxy
an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc::.


method::wrapFunc

Subclasses should override this method to implement wrapping of functions by instances of appropriate subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractMessageMatcher::.


method::getKeysForFuncProxy

Subclasses should override this to return an Array containing all the keys at which the specified responder func's functions are stored in this dispatchers active dictionary.

argument::funcProxy
an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc::.

returns::

an link::Classes/Array::.


method::update

Subclasses of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc:: should call update on their dispatcher whenever their function (or something else significant) changes.

argument::funcProxy
an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/AbstractResponderFunc::.

argument::what
a link::Classes/Symbol:: indicating what has changed. Currently the only thing supported is code::\function::.


method::free

this method removes this dispatcher from its responder func's dependants dictionaries, and deactivates it. Users should only call this method if you are finished with this dispatcher.
