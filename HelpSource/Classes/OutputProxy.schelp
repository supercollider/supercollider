class:: OutputProxy
summary:: Place holder for multiple outputs
categories:: UGens>Base

Description::

OutputProxy is used by some UGens as a place holder for multiple outputs.
There is no reason for a user to create an OutputProxy directly.

code::
var out;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
out = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0);
out.postln;

InstanceMethods::

method:: source
The UGen that is the source for this OutputProxy.
discussion::
code::
var left, right;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
# left, right = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0);
left.source.postln;
::

The code::source:: method is also defined in Array, so that the source can be obtained this way as well:

code::
var out;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
out = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0);
out.postln;
out.source.postln;
