CLASS::Order
summary:: an order of elements with a numerical index
related::Classes/SparseArray
categories:: Collections>Ordered

description::
keeps elements in an order and allows to put them at arbitrary slots
without having to allocate a large array.

note::
link::#-put:: and link::#-at:: are slower than in link::Classes/IdentityDictionary:: / link::Classes/PriorityQueue::, link::#-do:: is faster.
::

CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
creates a new order.
code::
g = Order.new;
g.put(7, 100); // put a value (100) at index 7
g.clear; // empty
::

method::newFromIndices
creates a new order from given items and indices.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

private::resetIndices, nextSlotFor, slotFor, prPutSlot

method::doRange
iterates over a range of the order's items.

method::pos
returns the current write position.

examples::

code::
a = Order.new;

a[0] = \z;
a[0] = \y;
a[5] = \five;
a[4] = \four;

a[0] = \z;
a[5] = \five;
a[4] = \four;

a.indices;

a[9] = 100;
a.indices;
