categories:: Collections>Ordered
summary:: An order of elements with a numerical index
related:: Classes/SparseArray










description::




Keeps elements in an order and allows to put them at arbitrary slots without having to allocate a large array.

note::
link::#-put:: and link::#-at:: are slower than in link::Classes/IdentityDictionary:: / link::Classes/PriorityQueue::, link::#-do:: is faster.
::










classmethods::




method:: new


Create a new order.

code::
g = Order.new;
g.put(7, 100); // put a value (100) at index 7
g.clear; // empty
::




method:: newFromIndices


Create a new order from given items and indices.










instancemethods::




private:: resetIndices, nextSlotFor, slotFor, prPutSlot


method:: doRange
Iterate over a range of the order's items.




method:: pos


Return the current write position.










examples::




code::
a = Order.new;

a[0] = \z;
a[0] = \y;
a[5] = \five;
a[4] = \four;

a[0] = \z;
a[5] = \five;
a[4] = \four;

a.indices;

a[9] = 100;
a.indices;
