description::


Limits the slope of an input signal. The slope is expressed in units per
second.

For smoothing out control signals, take a look at link::Classes/Lag:: and link::Classes/VarLag::


classmethods::


method::ar, kr

argument::in
the input signal.

argument::up
maximum upward slope in units per second.

argument::dn
maximum downward slope in units per second.

argument::mul
output will be multiplied by this value.

argument::add
this value will be added to the output.


examples::

code::

(
{
	z = LFPulse.ar(800);
	[z, Slew.ar(z, 4000, 4000)]
}.plot)



Has the effect of removing transients and higher frequencies.
(
{

	z = Saw.ar(800, mul: 0.2);
	Slew.ar(z, 400, 400)

}.play
)
