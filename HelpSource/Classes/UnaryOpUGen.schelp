summary:: Apply a unary operation to the values of an input ugen
related:: Classes/BinaryOpUGen, Classes/UnaryOpFunction, Classes/Punop, Overviews/Operators










description::




UnaryOpUGens are created as the result of a unary operator applied to a link::Classes/UGen::.

code::
(SinOsc.ar(200).abs).dump;
(LFSaw.ar(200).sin).dump;
::

As in the examples given here, you don't usually need to instantiate UnaryOpUGen yourself.

The unary and binary operators are defined in link::Classes/UGen::'s superclass link::Classes/AbstractFunction::, which creates the BinaryOpUGen as a result of the operation.

See link::Overviews/Operators:: for an overview of common operators.










classmethods::




method:: new


Return a new instance that applies the operator code::selector:: to the UGen code::a::


argument:: selector

The selector symbol for the unary operator


argument:: a

Operand










examples::




code::
a = WhiteNoise.ar; // a WhiteNoise
b = a.squared; // a UnaryOpUGen.
b.operator; // squared

// sound example

{ var a = LFSaw.ar(300).range(0, 2pi); a.sin * 0.1 }.play;

// Plotting the "abs" unary operator (via the server):

{ SinOsc.ar(300).abs }.plot
