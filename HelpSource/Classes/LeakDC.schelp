Description::

This is a linear filter that removes DC bias from a signal. Specifically, this is a one-pole highpass filter implementing the formula code:: y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1] + coef * y[n-1] ::. The frequency response of this filter is dependent on the sample rate of the server and the calculation rate of the UGen.

classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::in

The input signal.


argument::coef

Leak coefficient.


argument::mul

Output will be multiplied by this value.


argument::add

This value will be added to the output.


Examples::

code::
(
{
	var a;
	a = LFPulse.ar(800, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
	[a, LeakDC.ar(a, 0.995)]
}.scope(bufsize: 22050)
)
