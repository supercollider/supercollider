class:: Gendy3
summary:: Dynamic stochastic synthesis generator.
related:: Classes/Gendy1, Classes/Gendy2
categories::  UGens>Generators>Stochastic


Description::

See  link::Classes/Gendy1::  help file for background. This variant of
GENDYN normalises the durations in each period to force oscillation at
the desired pitch. The breakpoints still get perturbed as in
link::Classes/Gendy1:: .

There is some glitching in the oscillator caused by the stochastic
effects - control points as they vary cause big local jumps of amplitude.
Put  code::ampscale::  and  code::durscale::
low to minimise the rate of this.

SuperCollider implementation by Nick Collins

classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::ampdist

Choice of probability distribution for the next perturbation of
the amplitude of a control point.

The distributions are (adapted from the GENDYN program in Formalized Music):

table::
## 0: || LINEAR.
## 1: || CAUCHY.
## 2: || LOGIST.
## 3: || HYPERBCOS.
## 4: || ARCSINE.
## 5: || EXPON.
## 6: || SINUS.
::

Where the sinus (Xenakis' name) is in this implementation taken
as sampling from a third party oscillator. See example below.


argument::durdist

Choice of distribution for the perturbation of the current inter
control point duration.


argument::adparam

A parameter for the shape of the amplitude probability
distribution, requires values in the range 0.0001 to 1 (there are
safety checks in the code so don't worry too much if you want to
modulate!).


argument::ddparam

A parameter for the shape of the duration probability
distribution, requires values in the range 0.0001 to 1.


argument::freq

Oscillation frquency.


argument::ampscale

Normally 0.0 to 1.0, multiplier for the distribution's delta
value for amplitude. An ampscale of 1.0 allows the full range
of  -1 to 1 for a change of amplitude.


argument::durscale

Normally 0.0 to 1.0, multiplier for the distribution's delta
value for duration. An ampscale of 1.0 allows the full range of
-1 to 1 for a change of duration.


argument::initCPs

Initialise the number of control points in the memory.
Xenakis specifies 12. There would be this number of control
points per cycle of the oscillator, though the oscillator's
period will constantly change due to the duration distribution.


argument::knum

Current number of utilised control points, allows modulation.

argument::mul

argument::add

discussion::
All parameters can be modulated at control rate except for code::initCPs:: which is used only at initialisation.
