summary:: a list of color roles within a palette, and their meaning

A palette (see link::Classes/QPalette::) consists of colors assigned to various color roles within the three color groups (see link::Reference/palette_color_groups::). The following is a list of possible symbols to denote color roles, and their meanings.

table::
## strong::Role::    || strong::Meaning::
## 'window'          || Window background. Views may also use this role, for example to derive the color of their border. It is also the background of StaticText.
## 'windowText'      || Text on top of 'window', for example in StaticText.
## 'button'          || Everything button-alike. For example Button background, as well as Slider thumb.
## 'buttonText'      || Text on top of 'button'.
## 'brightText'      || May be used for text on pressed Button.
## 'base'            || Background of views that display a lot of text (TextView, ListView, etc.).
## 'baseText'        || Text on top of 'base'.
## 'alternateBase'   || ListView may use alternate background colors for rows.
## 'toolTipBase'     || Background of tooltips.
## 'toolTipText'     || Text of tooltips.
## 'highlight'       || Used to indicate selection, as in ListView, etc.
