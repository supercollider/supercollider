An event stream is a normal link::Classes/Stream:: that returns events when called. (see class link::Classes/Event::). Usually, an event stream requires an event to be passed in, often the default event is used:

code::
t = Pbind(\x, Pseq([1, 2, 3])).asStream; // Pbind, e.g. creates a stream
t.next(Event.default);
t.next(Event.default);
::

An event stream cannot be played directly with a clock, as it returns events and not time values.
Therefore, an link::Classes/EventStreamPlayer:: is used, which replaces the event by according time value.

A link::Classes/Pevent:: can be used to wrap a stream in an event:

code::
t = Pevent(Pbind(\x, Pseq([1,2,3])), Event.default).asStream;
t.next;
t.next;
