title:: Expression Sequence
summary:: sequence of expressions
categories:: Language

A sequence of expressions separated by semicolons and optionally terminated by a semicolon are a single expression whose value is the value of the last expression. Such a sequence may be used anywhere that a normal expression may be used.
code::
max( b = a * 2; b + 5,  10);	// computes the maximum of b+5 and 10
::
In the above example, the sequence: code:: b = a * 2; b + 5 :: acts as a single expression for the first argument to code::max()::.
