section::What's that Pbind thing?

Some of the examples in the last tutorial played notes using Pbind, and you might be wondering how it works in general and what else you can do with it.

In the most general sense, link::Classes/Pbind:: is just a way to give names to values coming out of the types of patterns we just saw. When you ask a Pbind stream for its next value, the result is an object called an link::Classes/Event::. Like a link::Classes/Dictionary:: (which is a superclass of Event), an event is a set of "key-value pairs": each value is named by a key.

code::
e = (freq: 440, dur: 0.5);	// an Event

e.at(\freq)		// access a value by name
e[\freq]
e.freq		// See IdentityDictionary help for more on this usage

e.put(\freq, 880);	// Change a value by name
e[\freq] = 660;
e.freq = 220;

e.put(\amp, 0.6);	// Add a new value into the event
e.put(\dur, nil);	// Remove a value
::

A Pbind is defined by a list of pairs: keys associated with the patterns that will supply the values for the events.

Things get interesting when the names associated with Pbind's sub-patterns are also link::Classes/SynthDef:: arguments. Then it becomes possible to play new Synths with Pbind, and feed their inputs with different values on each event.

section::Building an event, one key at a time

We can look at the return values from a Pbind by calling code::next:: on the stream. Note that it's necessary to pass an empty event into emphasis::next::, so that Pbind has somewhere to put the values.

code::
(
p = Pbind(
	\degree, Pseq(#[0, 0, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4], 1),
	\dur, Pseq(#[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1], 1)
).asStream;	// remember, you have to make a stream out of the pattern before using it
)

p.next(Event.new);	// shorter: p.next(())

// Output:
( 'degree': 0, 'dur': 0.5 )
( 'degree': 0, 'dur': 0.5 )
( 'degree': 4, 'dur': 0.5 )
( 'degree': 4, 'dur': 0.5 )
::

The return events show us what Pbind really does. Each time the next value is requested, it goes through each key-pattern pair and gets the next value from each pattern (actually streams, but Pbind makes streams out of the sub patterns internally). Each value gets put into the event, using the associated key.

For the first event, the first key is code::'degree':: and the value is code::0::. This is placed into the event before moving to the next pair: the event in transition contains code::( 'degree': 0 ) ::. Then the next key supplies code::0.5:: for code::'dur'::, and since there are no more pairs, the event is complete: code::( 'degree': 0, 'dur': 0.5 ) ::.

// User does:
code::
p.next(Event.new);
::
// SuperCollider processes:
numberedList::
## code::\degree:: stream returns code::0::
## Put it in the Event: code:: ( 'degree': 0 ) ::
## code::\dur:: stream returns code::0.5::
## Put it in the Event: code:: ( 'degree': 0, 'dur': 0.5 ) ::
## Return the result event.
::

note::
Dictionaries in SuperCollider are emphasis::unordered:: collections. Even though Pbind processes its child streams in the order given, the results can display the keys and values in any order. This does not affect the behavior of playing Events, as we will soon see.
::

section::Event, .play and event prototypes

So far we haven't seen anything that produces a note, just data processing: fetching values from patterns and stitching them together into events. The notes come from the difference between Events and regular Dictionaries: Events can do things when you code::.play:: them.

code::
( 'degree': 0, 'dur': 0.5 ).play;
::

The action that the event will take is defined in an "event prototype." The prototype must include a function for the code::'play':: key; this function is executed when code::.play:: is called on the event. Also, optionally the prototype can contain default values for a wide variety of parameters.

Pbind doesn't do much without an event prototype. Fortunately, you don't have to write the prototype on your own. There is a default event, accessed by code::Event.default::, that includes functions for many different server-messaging tasks. If no specific action is requested, the normal action is to play a Synth. That's why playing a Pbind, as in the previous tutorial, with only code::'degree':: and code::'dur':: patterns produced notes: each event produces at least one synth by default, and the default event prototype knows how to convert scale degrees into frequencies and code::'dur':: (duration) into note lengths.

When a pattern is played, an object called link::Classes/EventStreamPlayer:: is created. This object reads out the events one by one from the pattern's stream (using a given event prototype as the base), and calls code::play:: on each. The code::'delta':: value in the event determines how many beats to wait until the next event. Play continues until the pattern stops producing events, or you call .stop on the EventStreamPlayer. (Note that calling code::.stop:: on the pattern does nothing. Patterns are stateless and cannot play or stop by themselves.)

- strong::To sum up so far:: : A Pbind's stream generates Events. When an Event is played, it does some work that usually makes noise on the server. This work is defined in an event prototype. The Event class provides a default event prototype that includes powerful options to create and manipulate objects on the server.

subsection::Rests

Rests may be indicated in three ways.

list::
## strong::Recommended::
list::
## emphasis::Rest: :: A link::Classes/Rest:: object that converts the event being processed into a rest.
::
## strong::Legacy::
list::
## emphasis::Symbol as pitch: :: A symbol, such as strong::\rest::, strong::\r:: or even the empty symbol strong:: \ ::, in a key related to pitch (degree, note, midinote, freq) causes the event to be silent.
## emphasis::\type, \rest: :: Setting the event's \type to \rest also silences the event.
::
::

A more complete discussion is found in the link::Classes/Rest:: help file.

subsection::Useful Pbind variant: Pmono

Pbind plays separate notes by default. Sometimes, you might need a pattern to act more like a monophonic synthesizer, where it plays just one Synth node and changes its values with each event. If Pbind normally corresponds to code::Synth.new:: or code::/s_new::, link::Classes/Pmono:: corresponds to code::aSynth.set:: or code::/n_set::.

Compare the sound of these patterns. Pbind produces an attack on every note, while Pmono glides from pitch to pitch.

code::
p = Pbind(\degree, Pwhite(0, 7, inf), \dur, 0.25, \legato, 1).play;
p.stop;

p = Pmono(\default, \degree, Pwhite(0, 7, inf), \dur, 0.25).play;
p.stop;
::

Articulating phrases is possible with Pmono by chaining several Pmono patterns together in a row, or by using link::Classes/PmonoArtic::.

section::Connecting Event values to SynthDef inputs

Most SynthDefs have link::Classes/Control:: inputs, usually defined by arguments to the UGen function. For example, the default SynthDef (declared in Event.sc) defines five inputs: code::out::, code::freq::, code::amp::, code::pan:: and code::gate::.

code::
SynthDef(\default, { arg out=0, freq=440, amp=0.1, pan=0, gate=1;
	var z;
	z = LPF.ar(
			Mix.new(VarSaw.ar(freq + [0, Rand(-0.4,0.0), Rand(0.0,0.4)], 0, 0.3)),
			XLine.kr(Rand(4000,5000), Rand(2500,3200), 1)
		) * Linen.kr(gate, 0.01, 0.7, 0.3, 2);
	OffsetOut.ar(out, Pan2.ar(z, pan, amp));
}, [\ir]);
::

When an event plays a synth, any values stored in the event under the same name as a SynthDef input will be passed to the new synth. Compare the following:

code::
// Similar to Synth(\default, [freq: 293.3333, amp: 0.2, pan: -0.7])
(freq: 293.3333, amp: 0.2, pan: -0.7).play;

// Similar to Synth(\default, [freq: 440, amp: 0.1, pan: 0.7])
(freq: 440, amp: 0.1, pan: 0.7).play;
::

This leads to a key point: strong::The names that you use for patterns in Pbind should correspond to the arguments in the SynthDef being played::. The Pbind pattern names determine the names for values in the resulting Event, and those values are sent to the corresponding Synth control inputs.

The SynthDef to play is named by the code::'instrument':: key. To play a pattern using a different Synth, simply name it in the pattern.

code::
SynthDef(\harpsi, { |outbus = 0, freq = 440, amp = 0.1, gate = 1|
	var out;
	out = EnvGen.ar(Env.adsr, gate, doneAction: Done.freeSelf) * amp *
		Pulse.ar(freq, 0.25, 0.75);
	Out.ar(outbus, out ! 2);
}).add;	// see below for more on .add

p = Pbind(
		// Use \harpsi, not \default
	\instrument, \harpsi,
	\degree, Pseries(0, 1, 8),
	\dur, 0.25
).play;
::

It's actually an oversimplification to say that the Pbind names should always match up to SynthDef arguments.

list::
## A Pbind can use some values in the event for intermediate calculations (see link::Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_06g_Data_Sharing::). If these intermediate values have names not found in the SynthDef, they are not sent to the server. There is no requirement that every item in an Event must correspond to a SynthDef control.
## The default event prototype performs some automatic conversions. You might have noticed that the examples so far use code::'degree':: to specify pitch, but the default SynthDef being played does not have a degree argument. It works because the default event converts degree into code::'freq'::, which is an argument. The most important conversions are for pitch and timing. Timing is simple; pitch is more elaborate. See link::Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_07_Value_Conversions:: for an explanation of these automatic calculations.
::

strong::Don't send or load SynthDefs; use .add or .store instead::

To send only the relevant values to the new Synth, the Event needs to know what controls exist in the SynthDef. This is done by a library of descriptors for SynthDefs; the descriptor is a link::Classes/SynthDesc::, and the library is a link::Classes/SynthDescLib::. The normal methods -- code::.send(s)::, code::.load(s):: -- to communicate a SynthDef to the server do not enter it into the library. As a result, SynthDefs sent this way will not work properly with Pbind. Instead, use different methods that emphasis::store:: the SynthDef into the library.

code::
// Save into the library, write a .scsyndef file, and load it on the server
SynthDef(...).store;

// Save into the library and send the SynthDef to the server (no .scsyndef file)
// Make sure the server is booted before doing this
SynthDef(...).add;
::

.load(s)	-->	.store

.send(s)	-->	.add


section::"Rest" events

Beginning with version 3.5, rests may be indicated using the link::Classes/Rest:: class. Advantages:

list::
## Rests may be given in any Pbind key-value pair. (Previously, rests could be indicated only in \type, \degree, \note, \midinote or \freq.)
## A rest have a duration, e.g. code::Rest(0.5)::, and used in a duration stream (\dur or \delta).
## Addresses some problems with the former convention (to be discussed in brief below).
::

Ligeti's "touches bloquées" technique could be written this way (see link::Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_06e_Language_Control:: for an explanation of the conditional link::Classes/Pif::):

code::
(
// first, pitches ascending by 1-3 semitones, until 2 octaves are reached
var	pitches = Pseries(0, Pconst(24, Pwhite(1, 3, inf)), inf).asStream.all,
		// randomly block 1/3 of those
	mask = pitches.scramble[0 .. pitches.size div: 3];

p = Pbind(
	\arpeg, Pseq(pitches[ .. pitches.size - 2] ++ pitches.reverse[ .. pitches.size - 2], inf),
		// if the note is found in the mask array, replace it with Rest
		// then that note does not sound
	\note, Pif(Pfunc { |event| mask.includes(event[\arpeg]) }, Rest, Pkey(\arpeg)),
	\octave, 4,
	\dur, 0.125
).play;
)

p.stop;
::

Prior to 3.5, the convention to include a rest in the middle of an event pattern is to set the code::\freq:: key to a link::Classes/Symbol::. Commonly this is code::\rest::, but a backslash by itself is enough to suppress the note on the server. (This usage is still supported in 3.5, but not recommended.)

If it's the code::\freq:: key that determines whether the event as a rest or not, why does it work to use it with code::\note::? As noted, keys like code::\degree::, code::\note::, and code::\midinote:: are automatically converted into frequency. The math operations that perform the conversion preserve Symbols intact -- e.g., code::\rest + 1 == \rest:: . So the code::\rest:: value is passed all the way through the chain of conversions so that code::\freq:: in the event ends up receiving code::\rest::.

Note that it doesn't matter if the SynthDef has a code::freq:: argument. It's the event, on the emphasis::client:: side, that looks to this key to determine whether to play the note or not. If it is a rest, the server is not involved at all.

section::Writing SynthDefs for patterns

SynthDefs should have a couple of specific features to work well with patterns.

subsection::Synths should release themselves

The default event prototype relies on the synth to remove itself from the server when it's finished. This can be done in several ways:

list::
## (Most typical) A gated envelope with a releasing code::doneAction:: ( >= 2) in the envelope generator (see link::Classes/Done:: for a complete list). The code::\harpsi:: SynthDef above uses this technique. A gated envelope specifies a release node or uses one of the predefined sustaining envelope types: code::Env.asr::, code::Env.adsr::, code::Env.dadsr::. The link::Classes/Env:: help file offers more detail on gated envelopes.
## code::Linen.kr::, which is a shortcut for code::EnvGen.kr(Env([0, susLevel, 0], [attackTime, releaseTime], \lin, releaseNode: 1), gate, doneAction: [2 or higher]) ::. The default SynthDef uses this. The code::doneAction:: should be at least 2 to release the node.
note::
If the release is controlled by a gate, the gate must be represented by the synth argument code::gate::; standard event prototypes expect to be able to control the synth's release using this argument. Also, make sure the gate's default value is greater than 0. Otherwise, the envelope will never start and you will both hear nothing and watch synths pile up on the server.
::
## Fixed-duration envelopes (no gate).
::

subsection::Argument name prefixes

One other subtle point about synth argument names. In a SynthDef, argument names can have the prefix code::t_:: to indicate a "trigger control," or code::i_:: for an "initial rate" control (meaning that it holds the value set when the Synth is first played). This is described in link::Classes/SynthDef:: help. Pbind and its cousins should leave out the prefixes, e.g.:

code::
(
SynthDef(\trig_demo, { |out, freq = 440, gate = 1, t_trig = 1|	// t_trig here
	var	env = Decay2.kr(t_trig, 0.01, 0.1),
		sig = SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, env)
			* Linen.kr(gate, 0.01, 0.1, 0.1, doneAction: Done.freeSelf);
	Out.ar(out, sig ! 2)
}).add;
)

(
p = Pmono(\trig_demo,
	\freq, Pexprand(200, 800, inf),
	\trig, 1,	// note that this is NOT t_trig -- just \trig
	\delta, 0.125
).play;
)

p.stop;
