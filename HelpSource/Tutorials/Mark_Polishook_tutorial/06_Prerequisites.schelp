We know that SuperCollider applies a client/server model to audio synthesis and processing.
Let's focus on synthesis definition. Some things to consider:










section:: DSP




First, we require knowledge of digital signal processing. A reference, such as the "Computer Music Tutorial," (MIT Press) can be helpful. A source on the internet is "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing" at

http://www.dspguide.com/










section:: OOP




Second, we need to know how to use the SuperCollider language to express synthesis algorithms.
This means learning about object-oriented programming in general and about the grammar and syntax of the SuperCollider language in particular.
A book about Smalltalk, the object-oriented computer language that SuperCollider closely resembles, can be helpful. Two books about Smalltalk on the www are

The Art and Science of Smalltalk

http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~ducasse/FreeBooks/Art/artMissing186187Fix1.pdf

and

Smalltalk by Example

The SuperCollider documentation and numerous sites across the internet, such as the swiki at

http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/6

explain and show how the SuperCollider language works.
