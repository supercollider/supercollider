SECTION:: An introductory overview

SuperCollider is a cross-platform environment for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition used by musicians, artists and researchers working with sound, with three main components:

definitionlist::
## soft:: ::• soft:: ::link::Classes/Server:: – a real-time audio engine.||
The default server is link::Classes/Server#Switching the server application#scsynth::. To take full advantage of multi-core, an alternative sound engine, link::Classes/Server#Switching the server application#supernova::, can be used.

## soft:: ::• soft:: ::Client soft:: ::– sclang. a text-based programming language and interpreter. ||
In addition to managing server-side objects, sclang offers link::Overviews/JITLib##interactive programming environments for on-the-fly coding:: and extensive libraries for creating diverse link::Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction##patterns:: in music and sound, as well as a wide range of link::Classes/Scale##scales and modes:: from various cultures. Creating link::Tutorials/Getting-Started/15-Sequencing-with-Routines-and-Tasks##processes:: that unfold over time is easy in sclang. It also provides all the essential features of a link::Guides/GUI-Introduction##graphical user interface:: that can be extended to create animated visual effects. With support for link::Guides/UsingMIDI##MIDI::, link::Guides/OSC_communication##OSC:: and link::Guides/Working_with_HID##HID::, sclang can be easily interfaced with local and networked hardware and software.

## soft:: ::• soft:: ::link::Classes/ScIDE:: soft:: ::– a dedicated editor for SuperCollider with an integrated help system.||
link::Guides/SCIde##The SuperCollider-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) :: allows you to start writing code right out of the box. Alternatively, if you are already familiar with a particular code editor, you can use your favourite front-end instead to benefit from the flavour features of your preferred editor: e.g. link::https://github.com/scztt/vscode-supercollider##Visual Studio Code, VSCodium::, link::https://github.com/capital-G/sc_kernel##Jupyter::, link::https://github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim##SCNvim::, link::https://github.com/supercollider/scvim##scvim::, link::https://github.com/supercollider/scel##Emacs::, and so on.
::

link::Guides/NodeMessaging##The server and client communicate:: via link::http://opensoundcontrol.org/##OSC (open sound control):: messages over link::Guides/Glossary#kw_udp#UDP::, allowing SuperCollider to link::Guides/ClientVsServer#Description#run on a single machine or on multiple machines over a network::.

If you wish, you can extend SuperCollider's functionality by installing optional link::https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins##sc3-plugins:: distributed by the SC development team, and by installing individual extensions from the custom libraries called link::Classes/Quarks:: developed by individual users. For more information, see the link::https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks##Directory of community contributed Quarks for SuperCollider:: and the link::https://quarks.supercollider.online/##SuperCollider Quarks Web Index::.

SuperCollider link::https://www.audiosynth.com##was originally developed:: by James McCartney and link::https://supercollider.github.io/##is now distributed:: as Free Software under the GNU General Public License. It link::https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider##is maintained and developed :: by an active and enthusiastic community.
