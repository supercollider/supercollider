SECTION:: An introductory overview

SuperCollider* is a cross-platform** environment for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition used by musicians, artists and researchers working with sound, with three main components:

definitionlist::
## soft:: ::• soft:: ::link::Classes/Server:: – a real-time audio engine.||
The default server is link::Classes/Server#Switching the server application#scsynth::. To take full advantage of multi-core, an alternative sound engine, link::Classes/Server#Switching the server application#supernova::, can be used.

## soft:: ::• soft:: ::Client soft:: ::– sclang. a text-based programming language and interpreter. ||

emphasis::sclang:: controls audio synthesis processes on the server and offers an link::Overviews/JITLib##interactive programming environment for on-the-fly coding::, link::Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/PG_01_Introduction##an extensive library for creating patterns:: and link::Classes/Scale##a library of scales and modes from various cultures::.
link::Tutorials/Getting-Started/15-Sequencing-with-Routines-and-Tasks##Creating processes that unfold over time:: is straighforward in sclang.
It also provides link::Guides/GUI-Introduction##all the essential features of a graphical user interface:: that can be used to create custom user interfaces and data visualization.
With support for
link::Guides/UsingMIDI##MIDI::,
link::Guides/OSC_communication##OSC:: and
link::Guides/Working_with_HID##HID::,
sclang can be easily interfaced with local and networked hardware and software.

## soft:: ::• soft:: ::link::Classes/ScIDE:: soft:: ::– a dedicated editor for SuperCollider with an integrated help system.||
link::Guides/SCIde##The SuperCollider-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) :: allows you to start writing code right out of the box. Community members also maintain sclang integration with other popular IDEs such as link::https://github.com/scztt/vscode-supercollider##Visual Studio Code, VSCodium::, link::https://github.com/capital-G/sc_kernel##Jupyter::, link::https://github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim##SCNvim::, link::https://github.com/supercollider/scvim##scvim::, link::https://github.com/supercollider/scel##Emacs::, and so on.
::

link::Guides/ClientVsServer##The server and client:: communicate via link::http://opensoundcontrol.org/##OSC (open sound control):: messages over link::Guides/Glossary#kw_udp#UDP::, allowing SuperCollider to run on a single machine or link::Guides/MultiClient_Setups##on multiple machines over a network::. Users can also diretly control the sc-server using link::Guides/NodeMessaging::.

If you wish, you can extend SuperCollider's functionality by installing optional link::https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins##sc3-plugins:: distributed by the SC development team, and by installing individual extensions from the custom libraries called link::Classes/Quarks:: developed by individual users. For more information, see the link::https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks##Directory of community contributed Quarks for SuperCollider:: and the link::https://quarks.supercollider.online/##SuperCollider Quarks Web Index::.

table::
## * SuperCollider link::https://www.audiosynth.com##was originally developed:: by James McCartney and link::https://supercollider.github.io/##is now distributed:: as Free Software under the GNU General Public License. It link::https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider##is maintained and developed :: by an active and enthusiastic community.

table::
##** SuperCollider can be installed and run on link::https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html#linux#Linux::,
link::https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html#mac#macOS:: and
link::https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html#windows#Windows::,
as well as microcomputers such as
link::https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/README_RASPBERRY_PI.md##Raspberry Pie:: and
link::https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/README_BEAGLEBONE_BLACK.md##BeagleBone Black::.
link::https://www.arduino.cc/##Arduino:: or equivalent devices can be
controlled via link::Classes/SerialPort:: within sclang.
DMX can also be used by means of user-developed libraries (link::https://quarks.supercollider.online/##type dmx in the search box on the linked web page::
).
